# NCEA LLM Classification Engine

This is a simple classification engine that uses a pre-trained model to classify a given catalogue entry into the NCEA Ontology.

## Ontology

The NCEA Ontology is a simple 3 level hierarchy that provides a way of navigating data in the NCEA catalogue. Previously the hierarchy has been avialable in excel format; however to make it more accessible to developers and machine readable it has been converted into a skos concept scheme. The initial output can be found in `ontology/`.
