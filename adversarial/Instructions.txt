Classify various datasources and reports represented by a catalogue record within the environment domain into an ontology which describes Natural Capital, Ecosystem Services, Pressures, and Natural Assets across a three-level hierarchy. The purposes of this classification is to enable users to discover and access data and reports using a progressive search using this ontology. Previously users have had to use domain-specific knowledge and exact keyword terms to find relevant data; and users have often missed out on relevant existant data.
