It details records about pollution and invasive species, as well as potential disturbances to biodiversity. Hence, appropriate classifications include chemical pollution (lv2-012), nutrient enrichment (lv3-074), biological disturbances (lv2-013), introduction or spread of invasive non-indigenous species (lv3-078), and biodiversity loss and extinction (lv3-082). At the top level, this falls under Environmental pressures or impacts (lvl1-004)."

This shape file shows the approximate locations of our monitoring sites and the compliance or classification for each bathing water in England from 1988 to present. It is updated twice a year, to revise the inventory, and the assessment results. For coastal waters the specific locations of monitoring vary along a transect with the changing of the tides. The results of these samples are assessed in annual classifications and are available to view and download through the bathing water data explorer. This data is covered by AfA470.
