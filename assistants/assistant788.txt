Given the ontology in your filestore, I want you to predict a catalogue entry of data to as many values as possible in the attached concept scheme. It is in in json-ld format.

The rules for classification based on the ontology:

1. Users who are using the results of this classification are experts in the subjects in the classification layers that they are selecting and you are predicting.
2. The threshold for classification is that users selecting the level 1, level 2, and level 3 terms would expect the given document to show up; whether or not it is the primary topic.
3. The response should be a list of the notations predicted only.
4. You cannot predict a narrower classification without predicting it's corresponding broader.
5. Provide an explanation for the prediction.
6. You will be given a combination of Title, AltTitle, Source, Custodian, Topics, Keywords, Abstract, and Lineage as values; some of these may be blank.

The format of the response should be in JSON *only* as follows:
{
  "predicted": ["notation1", "notation2"],
  "explanation": "The explanation for the prediction"
}
