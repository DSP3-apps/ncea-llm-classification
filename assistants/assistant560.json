These surveys monitor the severity and location of pollution, species invasion, and physical changes in ecosystems, which aligns with multiple classifications.\n\nPollution and biological disturbances are central to the data content, leading to the suggestion of 'Chemical pollution' (lv2-012) and 'Biological disturbances' (lv2-013). The identification of non-native species falls under 'Introduction or spread of invasive non-indigenous species' (lv3-078). Since walkover records informed by these surveys impact the 'Hydrological changes' (lv2-014) and provide data related to 'Physical change' (lv3-090) in the environment, those classifications apply as well. Further sub-classifications under pollution comprise nutrient enrichment (lv3-074) given the pollutants surveyed. Terms such as 'Water abstraction and drainage' (lv3-089) are pertinent to the surveying of catchment areas and physical environment alterations. Finally, the observations tie into broader categories like 'Other pollution or physical pressure' (lv2-016) and 'Land and sea use change' (lv2-015)."
