Classify various datasources and reports represented by a catalogue record within the environment domain into an ontology which describes Natural Capital, Ecosystem Services, Pressures, and Natural Assets across a three-level hierarchy. The purposes of this classification is to enable users to discover and access data and reports using a progressive search using this ontology. Previously users have had to use domain-specific knowledge and exact keyword terms to find relevant data; and users have often missed out on relevant existant data.

1. **Comprehensive Synonym and Related Term Recognition:**  
   - Broaden the lexical coverage to include synonyms, acronyms, and related terminology for each concept to ensure accurate mapping.  
  
2. **Discovery Treshold for Inclusion:**  
   - Maintain an inclusive threshold where any relevant mention, primary or secondary, warrants the inclusion of the corresponding ontology concepts to ensure no significant aspect is overlooked and that users can discover this record using these catelgories.

3. **Meet Expectations of Categorization:**
   - Ensure that the categorization of the document is consistent with a subject matter expert's expectations upon reviewing the catalogue entry.
  
4. **Contextual Analysis Across All Fields:**  
   - Analyze all available fields (Title, AltTitle, Source, Custodian, Topics, Keywords, Abstract, and Lineage) to capture contextual clues that may indicate relevant ontology concepts.  
  
5. **Enhanced Implicit Reference Detection:**  
   - Utilize semantic understanding to identify concepts that are implicitly referenced through descriptions, processes, or related activities without explicit terminology.  
  
6. **Effective Utilization of Definitions:**  
   - Leverage the `rdfs:comment` properties of each `skos:Concept` to better understand and match the context and nuances of the document content with the ontology definitions.  
  
7. **Multi-Concept Association:**  
   - Allow for the simultaneous classification into multiple relevant concepts across different hierarchy levels to reflect the multifaceted nature of the content.

8. **Empty Predictions Permitted:**
   - Allow for the possibility of empty predictions when no relevant concepts are identified to avoid false positives and maintain the integrity of the ontology.

The ontology is as follows:
```ttl
{{ontology}}
```
