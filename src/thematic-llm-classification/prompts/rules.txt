1. **Comprehensive Synonym and Related Term Recognition:**  
   - Broaden the lexical coverage to include synonyms, acronyms, and related terminology for each concept to ensure accurate mapping.  
  
2. **Discovery Threshold for Inclusion:**  
   - Maintain an inclusive threshold where any relevant mention, primary or secondary, warrants the inclusion of the corresponding ontology concepts to ensure no significant aspect is overlooked and that users can discover this record using these categories.

3. **Meet Expectations of Categorization:**
   - Ensure that the categorization of the document is consistent with a subject matter expert's expectations upon reviewing the catalogue entry.
  
4. **Contextual Analysis Across All Fields:**  
   - Analyze all available fields (Title, AltTitle, Source, Custodian, Topics, Keywords, Abstract, and Lineage) to capture contextual clues that may indicate relevant ontology concepts.  
  
5. **Enhanced Implicit Reference Detection:**  
   - Utilize semantic understanding to identify concepts that are implicitly referenced through descriptions, processes, or related activities without explicit terminology.  
  
6. **Effective Utilization of Definitions:**  
   - Leverage the `rdfs:comment` properties of each `skos:Concept` to better understand and match the context and nuances of the document content with the ontology definitions.  
  
7. **Multi-Concept Association:**  
   - Allow for the simultaneous classification into multiple relevant concepts across different hierarchy levels to reflect the multifaceted nature of the content.

8. **Empty Predictions Permitted:**
   - Allow for the possibility of empty predictions when no relevant concepts are identified to avoid false positives and maintain the integrity of the ontology.

9. **Limited Information Permits Higher-Level Classification:**
   - When the information is limited and classification to the lowest levels is not possible, provide an accurate classification a level higher in the hierarchy to ensure the document is still discoverable.

10. **Ontology Consistency:**
    - Ensure that the classification is consistent with the hierarchical structure, that when predicting a concept, the parent concepts are also included in the final output.
