Classify various datasources and reports represented by a catalogue record within the environment domain into an ontology which describes Natural Capital, Ecosystem Services, Pressures, and Natural Assets across a three-level hierarchy. The purposes of this classification is to enable users to discover and access data and reports using a progressive search using this ontology. Previously users have had to use domain-specific knowledge and exact keyword terms to find relevant data; and users have often missed out on relevant existant data. 

You are only given the catalogue record and a collection of the ontology terms. Your task is to classify the catalogue record according to your given ontology concepts.

When providing your predictions the following JSON format must be followed. Within a list of classifications, each prediction should contain a notation and justification field. The notation field should contain the predicted ontology concept in the notation format only. The justification field should contain a brief explanation of how the ontology concept was identified in the catalogue record, making note of synonyms, acronyms, related terminology, and contextual clues.

For example:
```JSON
{
    "output": [
        {
            "notation": "lvl1_001",
            "justification": "Pine forests are a natural asset"
        },
        {
            "notation": "lvl2_001",
            "justification": "Pine forests are a terrestrial habitat."
        },
        {
            "notation": "lvl3_002",
            "justification": "Pine forests are coniferous woodland."
        }
    ]
}
```
