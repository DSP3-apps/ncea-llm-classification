Sea-levels have risen 1-3 mm yr-1 in the last century (Cazenave & Nerem, 2004, Church et al., 2004, Church & White, 2006).  The global mean sea-level has risen by 0.16 m (a range of 0.12-0.21 m) between 1902 and 2015 (IPCC, 2019).  The rate of rise in 2006-2015 is unprecedented compared to the last century, during which period, sea-level rise has been dominated by melting ice-sheets and glaciers (IPCC, 2019).\r\nA rise in sea-level increases the water depth at the shore and results in increased wave and tidal energy along the shore, due to the increase in fetch and reduction in wave attenuation (Pethick, 2001; Crooks, 2004; Fujii, 2012).  As a result, coastal landforms (e.g. subtidal bedforms, intertidal flats, saltmarshes, shingle banks, sand dunes, cliffs and coastal lowlands) migrate along and parallel to the shore to maintain their position with the coastal energy gradient (Cooks, 2004; Fujii, 2012).  Sedimentary habitats are dynamic and liable to adapt to sea-level rise, except where hard structures (e.g. cliffs and artificial structures) prevent their natural movement, where existing intertidal areas are likely to be submerged, eroded, or moved (coastal squeeze).",

It is related to activities disturbing sediment and/or organic particulate matter and mobilizing it into the water column. It could be 'natural' land run-off and riverine discharges or from anthropogenic activities such as all forms of dredging, disposal at sea, cable and pipeline burial, and secondary effects of construction works, e.g. breakwaters. Particle size, hydrological energy (current speed & direction) and tidal excursion are all influencing factors on the spatial extent and temporal duration. Salinity, turbulence, pH and temperature may result in flocculation of suspended organic matter. Anthropogenic sources are mostly short-lived and over relatively small spatial extents.

Activities associated with this pressure type include mariculture, land claim, navigation dredging, disposal at sea, marine mineral extraction, cable and pipeline laying and various construction activities. It can result in short-lived sediment concentration gradients and the accumulation of sediments on the sea floor. This accumulation of sediments is synonymous with \"light\" smothering, which relates to the depth of vertical overburden. Light smothering relates to the deposition of layers of sediment on the seabed. It is associated with activities such as sea disposal of dredged materials where sediments are deliberately deposited on the sea bed. For light smothering most benthic biota may be able to adapt, i.e. vertically migrate through the deposited sediment.\r\nHeavy smothering also relates to the deposition of layers of sediment on the seabed but is associated with activities such as sea disposal of dredged materials where sediments are deliberately deposited on the sea bed. This accumulation of sediments relates to the depth of vertical overburden where the sediment type of the existing and deposited sediment has similar physical characteristics because, although most species of marine biota are unable to adapt, e.g. sessile organisms unable to make their way to the surface, a similar biota could, with time, re-establish.

In extreme cases, noise pressures may lead to death.

High amplitude low and mid-frequency impulsive sounds and low frequency continuous sounds are of greatest concern for effects on marine mammals and fish. Some species may be responsive to the associated particle motion rather than the usual concept of noise. Noise propagation can be over large distances (tens of kilometres) but transmission losses can be attributable to factors such as water depth and sea bed topography.
