This dataset includes the latest objectives of all water bodies in the Medway catchment. Water body objectives consist of two pieces of information: the status and the date by which that status is planned to be achieved. The status part of an objective is based on a prediction of the future status classification that would be achieved if technically feasible measures are implemented and, when implemented, would give rise to more benefits than they cost. The objective also takes into account the requirement to prevent deterioration and, as far as practicable, the requirements of protected areas. The date part of an objective is determined by considering whether the measures needed to achieve the planned status are currently affordable and, once implemented, the time taken for ecology or the groundwater to recover.

Samples were obtained in cores taken along a 50m transect line stretched out across the seabed from the edge of the cages. At two of the sites, fish cages had been operating for approximately 15 months whilst the third site had only been subjected to fish farm inputs for 4 months. At one of the older cage sites, situated in a very sheltered voe, the muddy sediments supported a low diversity community of which the main components were Capitella capitata and unidentified nematodes. Although apparently stressed, no gradients in community structure attributable to fish farm inputs were discernable. This may have been due to the transect line used not being long enough to include the whole of the gradient from polluted to clean conditions, because diver observations certainly suggested the existence of farm input-related gradients in other more readily visible parameters. At the other two sites, sediments were coarser and more mixed although the seabed at one of these was clearly more exposed to tidal currents than the other. They both supported a diverse infauna; that from the more exposed site numerically dominated by Corophium crassicorne, and that from the more sheltered site by Capitomastus minimus and unidentified oligachaetes. At the more exposed (and most recent) of these sites, the infauna within approximately 5m of the cages had been modified by fish farm inputs, and consisted predominantly of dense populations of Capitella capitata. Similar changes had occurred at the more sheltered of these two farm sites although here they extended out to approximately 15m from the cages.", "lineage": "This survey was extracted from a Marine Recorder snapshot."}

This aim of this work was to establish a baseline biological dataset that would: (1) facilitate the assessment of the favourable condition status of the habitats in the future; and (2) to allow a judgement to be formed on the current condition of these habitats. This work consisted of an extensive drop-down video drift survey at 135 sites, supplementary infaunal grab sampling of sediments at 30 sites, and a detailed reef and mixed reef/sediment habitat survey along 11 relocatable transects. Additionally, maerl bed dive transect surveys were performed at 3 maerl bed sites and the distribution of the unattached form of knotted wrack and beds of mussel was mapped.", "lineage": "This data was collected by SNH between the 2nd - 6th August 2009, from the vessel RV Serpula. This SCM survey was conducted using a combination of methods, including extensive drop-down video of sublittoral reef and sediment biotopes at 135 sites, infaunal grab sampling at 30 sites and 11 relocatable transects to survey shore and nearshore reef and sediment biotopes. Surveys were also performed at 3 maerl sites.  DDV and Diver Video Survey: The SAC was divided into six sectors, with 120 DDV sites allocated in proportion to area. The 2001 broadscale biotope map was used inform locations for examination in this survey, additional sites were also positioned within each sector to ensure good geographical spread and coverage of the range of biotopes, depths, exposure, and anthropogenic activities in the area. Video images were collected using a Panasonic NV-GS150 3 chip digital video camera. The video was recorded on a MiniDV tape. The camera was deployed for approximately 2-3 minutes from a drifting vessel at each station. positional and time/depth data were recorded at each station. 66 dive video sites were selected for examination from the 2001 broadscale survey sites. A further 3 sites were examined by spot dives on the 18th August 2009. At each site video images of the habitat were collected by one diver and biota present and substrate details were recorded by a second diver. On September 3rd 2009 a further 12 DDV sites (maerl bed adjacent to a fish farm) were surveyed by SNH on board the RIB Aphrodite, using a similar methodology to the main DDV survey. Video material was processed in a laboratory, with the SACFOR scale of abundance employed where possible during the analysis to quantify the species and substrate present. Based on the physical and biological attributes, biotopes were allocated. Stations were also characterized as 'reef', 'non-reef'. or 'mixed' habitats based on the presence of reef biotopes or a mixture of reef and non-reef biotopes.  Infaunal Grab: Grab survey carried out from the RV Serpula from 5th-7th August 2009 to provide information on the distribution and diversity of sediment biotopes. 21 sites were surveyed - the same sites as those visited in 2001 broadscale mapping survey. An additional 7 sites were sampled in 2009, making a total of 30 sites. These 30 sites were also surveyed in the video survey to facilitate biotope identification. A single 0.1m2 Van Veen grab sample was taken at each station. A 150ml subsample was taken from each grab for PSA analysis in the laboratory, and the remainder passed through a 1mm mesh. At 5 sites (representing a broad range of sediment types) the sediment was passed through a 0.5 mm sieve to enable comparisons with the 2001 survey. At one site, an additional macrobenthic sample was taken by diver. This consisted of 8 pooled 10.3 cm cores, sieved using a 1mm mesh. Macrobenthos samples were processed in the laboratory and identified to species where possible and counted.  Transect Survey: Nine reef and mixed reef/sediment transects were established (with one relocation due to adverse conditions). These transects represented a wide geographical and exposure range, allowing examination of the outer, middle, and inner loch and also comparison with previous data. The transect route at each site was marked by a 200m graduated line attached to the transect. The transect extended from the shore to the subtidal, where scuba divers laid it along the seabed. A band 2m either side of the tape was surveyed intertidally and subtidally using MNCR Phase 2 survey methodology. Within each zone (defined in terms of differences in the composition of biological community and/or substrate type) records were taken of biota and substrate type using the MNCR SACFOR scale of abundance. Video and still imagery were used to make representative visual recordings of the transect zones and biota. Maerl bed transect surveys were carried out by divers at the same three sites examined in the 2009 baseline survey. A 25m tape transect line was marked out and a 2m band either side of the tape was surveyed by divers using MNCR Phase 2 methodology. Presence and estimates of abundance of conspicuous biota were noted by two surveyors. Video footage and still photographs were collected to retain a visual record of the nature of the habitat and community for the purpose of supplementary material to aid habitat description. based on DDV results, 4 maerl sites were selected for examination. 4 replicate core samples were taken in areas of live maerl using a 10.3 diameter corer to a depth of 20cm. An additional 20cm sediment core of 5cm diameter was taken for PSA."}

This is termed the Primary habitat e.g. lowland heathland.  The main baseline data used for this is the Priority Habitat Inventories (PHIv2.2).  The location of additional habitat that naturally form mosaics with the primary habitat e.g. habitats that are most likely to form ecological mosaics possibly used by species associated with the primary habitat.  This is termed the Associated habitat. The main baseline data used for this is the Priority Habitat Inventories (PHIv2.2).  The locations where habitat creation or restoration is known to occur, this is primarily sites under relevant agri-environment options.  This is termed the Habitat creation  Sites where data suggests small fragments of the primary habitat or degraded habitat exists and where restoration may be possible, this is primarily developed from information held within the current PHI v2.2. This is termed the Restorable habitat.   Network Zones;  Land within close proximity to the existing habitat components that are more likely to be suitable for habitat re-creation for the particular habitat.  These areas are primarily based on soils but in many cases has been refined by also using other data such as hydrology, altitude and proximity to the coast. This is termed the Network Enhancement Zone 1.  Land within close proximity to the existing habitat components that are unlikely to be suitable for habitat re-creation but where other types of habitat may be created or land management may be enhanced including delivery of suitable Green Infrastructure. This is termed the Network Enhancement Zone 2.  Land immediately adjoining existing habitat patches that are small or have excessive edge to area ratio where habitat creation is likely to help reduce the effects of habitat fragmentation.  This is termed the Fragmentation Action Zone.  Land within relatively close proximity to  the Network Enhancement Zones 1 &amp; 2 that are more likely to be suitable for habitat creation for the particular habitat and identifying possible locations for connecting and linking up networks across a landscape.

Further details are outlined in the Habitat Network Mapping Guidance document. The Network boundary is drawn around the 4 habitat components using a variable buffering process with a generalised distance of 500m although 1km was used for Blanket Bog.  As the boundary for each habitat network is tightly drawn around the existing patches of habitat this means that at a national scale the habitat network is composed of a series of smaller networks that encapsulates one or more clusters of existing habitat patches.

There would be a natural population decline due to nutrient depletion and grazing pressures in the summer.

The Sarns (reefs) are interesting geological features, being shallow sublittoral glacial moraines. The survey was conducted from the hard boat `St Margaret', and based at Abersoch on the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales. Daily trips were made out to the reefs, and diving operations were based on the hard boat with inflatable tender for divers. At each site surveyed, records were made of abundance of plants and animals, and habitats were described. Suction samples were taken of sediment infauna at several sites. Photographs were taken to illustrate habitats, communities and species. The Sarns were remarkable for the extensive areas of distinctive communities on `unstable' substrata. A wide variety of algae, particularly Phaeophyta (brown algae), was recorded. At most survey sites, algae were dense and animal species were fewer and less varied. Twenty sites were surveyed, and descriptions of the different habitats and communities found on the reefs are given. The reefs were composed entirely of `unstable' substrata, of a wide range of sizes from large boulders down to fine sand. Distinctive communities dominated by ephemeral algae, were present in the sublittoral fringe on the reef crests, where there were mixed substrata exposed to fast tidal currents and strong wave action. In slightly deeper water, dense foliose algae dominated all hard substrata, with few animals present. Between 4 m and 9 m, Halidrys siliquosa forests covered extensive areas on boulders and cobbles in sediment. Pebbles were patchy but with a characteristic flora. In deeper water off the ends of the reefs, animal communities with a wide variety of species were present on tideswept boulders. Areas between the reefs were mainly covered with sand, and not investigated thoroughly. The conservation importance of the reefs as a whole is assessed, and of the 10 community types described. 11 algal and 4 animal species are identified as being of particular scientific interest. Many of the communities described are considered of regional or local importance; however the current-swept reef crests and the extensive Halidrys forests are considered to be of higher importance. The reefs as a whole are probably unique sublittoral features in the British Isles. Further work is recommended on Sarn-y-Bwch and Cynfelin Patches, both inadequately surveyed. The large boulder habitat, and areas at both the seaward and landward ends of the Sarns deserve further study.", "lineage": "This survey was extracted from a Marine Recorder snapshot."}

All locations were at similar depths of 1 m. This took place during March 2015. Along each transect the number and size of all coralliths and total number of non-free living individuals were recorded, alongside with several environmental parameters (Water Temperature, Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR), Total Alkalinity, Dissolved Inorganic Carbon and Dissolved Oxygen). Abundance and size of coralliths was recorded through non-invasive techniques and the environmental parameters were obtained through multiple instruments: Fluorometer, Oxygen sensor, spectrophotometry, Titration and a PAR logger.

Survey methodology included drop-down and diver video, grabbing and dredging and diver surveying of maerl, burrowed mud and Ostrea edulis habitats, with collection of replicate core samples for infaunal analysis of the maerl beds. 98 sites were surveyed by drop-down video from RV Serpula. The video system used consisted of a Panasonic NV-GS150 3 chip digital video camera within a Seapro housing held within a frame and illuminated by twin 100 watt lamps. At each station the camera was deployed from a drifting vessel for between 3-8 minutes, and the times, depths and precise positions at the start and end of the drift using dGPS noted. Linne Mhuirich was inaccessible to RV Serpula so video runs were carried out by diving at six sites in this area using a hand-held HD video camera (Sony HD Model XR550). The video material from each station was processed in the laboratory; species present were identified and quantified using the semi-quantitative MNCR SACFOR scale, as far as possible. Where video runs traversed a sequence of biotopes, the runs are split into corresponding segments with the transition points recorded using time. Segmentation of runs was not practicable in the case of mosaics of recurring biotopes, in which case all biotopes observed were simply listed.  To assist in the process of biotope identification and condition assessment, single 0.1 m2 van Veen grab samples were taken at 25 stations with a c.150 ml subsample taken for particle size analysis and the remaining material sieved on a 1 mm mesh and preserved in buffered 5% formalin. In addition, a further three replicate grab samples were collected at one where there is a historical record of inshore deep mud. During phase 2 of the survey programme the infauna at four additional sites were examined using duplicate, pooled mini van Veen grab samples (total area 0.09 m2), with the contents of a third grab subsampled for particle size analysis. One naturalist dredge tow was carried out through an area of historical Limaria bed records to supplement video samples taken at the same location and single anchor dredge samples were also collected at four sites in areas of historical records of Maxmuelleria. MNCR phase 2 surveys were carried out by diving on good examples of the biotope SS.SMu.CFiMu.MegMax. A band 4 m either side of the 25m transect tape was surveyed by two divers, who noted the presence, and where possible, estimated the abundance of conspicuous biota, collecting material which needed to be identified in the laboratory. To supplement the real-time visual records and collections, the transect band was videoed using a hand-held digital HD video camera (Canon Legria HF S30) and still photographs taken of the habitat and associated community using two Fuji Finepix S2 Pro digital still cameras with 14 mm wide-angle and 90 mm macro lenses. All video footage was analysed by contractor Dr Colin Moore and the faunal samples were processed by Fugro EMU (Edinburgh)."}

The Skomer surveys were mainly a reconnaissance of the area whilst at Grassholm and Martins Haven, systematic surveys of the abundance of species in different habitats were carried out. The sites studied were subject to widely different regimes of exposure to water movement and included steep cliffs often extending into deep water, broken rock slopes, boulders and a variety of mixed sediments. A total of twenty-one sites were surveyed and the survey results are presented as an annotated list of 89 plant and 201 animal species with a description of each site, and summary of the communities present in different habitats. The survey results for Skomer and Martins Haven have been compared with the descriptions of the nine sublittoral habitats and communities defined for the whole coast of the area by Hunnam (1976). Although there are many similarities in the two sets of data, several of the habitats described here were either not encountered by Hunnam or their individual characteristics were lost in the generalised description of communities within a small number of habitat categories. The area described here included a wide variety of habitats and communities compared to most other locations of similar area in south-west Britain. Several locations were identified as of scientific interest. In addition, several species normally confined to the south or west coasts of the British Isles and abundant around Lundy were recorded but in very small amounts. It is recommended that future work related to conservation interests in the area should include studies of the west coast of Grassholm and The Smalls, and detailed descriptions of habitats and communities at key sites already identified in the region of Skomer. Some further basic survey to include previously undescribed habitats and communities and to provide a basis for mapping is also required in the region of Skomer.", "lineage": "This survey was extracted from a Marine Recorder snapshot."}

There is a high likelihood of surviving prehistoric archaeology (10,000 - 5000 years old) in certain areas of SEA7, most notably to the west of the Outer Hebrides for a distance of some 10km, to a depth of -20m, and in and among the islands elsewhere (particularly around Islay, Jura, Mull and the Small Isles) along the coast and between S Scotland and N Ireland.The reasons comprise a complex interplay of changing sea level and the rebound of the land once freed from the compression of ice at the end of the last Ice Age. The net result of these physical effects is that 10,000 years ago relative sea level has been up to 45m lower along much of the coast and this corresponds with the period of early human settlement in the area. In places this means that considerable areas of submerged land exist. An investigation of bathymetric, sedimentary and tidal data for the area suggests that the prehistoric land surface, including archaeological remains, may survive in many places. Cooperation between existing extraction companies and renewable industries and archaeologists elsewhere in Britain shows how the recording and investigation of archaeological material could be beneficial to both parties should work take place in SEA7.

This is present as a result of being emitted by plants further up the Plym. It covers large areas, usually deposited in layers or bands, and restricts the mobility of the sediment macrofauna to the extent of it being near unhabitable. Certain common estuarine species such as Corophium volutator appear to be unusually low in number. This observation is suggested to be a reason for the poor bird population found around the estuary. Species such as Hediste diversicolor and Carcinus maenas however are found in high numbers. It is recommended that the China Clay deposits in the estuary are mapped and studied in full. Also, more work is recommended on populations of particular species such as Corophium volutator, and a 12 month study conducted on the estuarine bird population.", "lineage": "This survey was extracted from a Marine Recorder snapshot."}

The Sensitive Catchment Integrated Modelling Analysis Platform (SCIMAP) is a sediment risk assessment model which uses a digital terrain elevation, land use or land cover data and rainfall data to give an indication of where the relative risk of sediment erosion and delivery to a watercourse is greatest in a catchment. This model was run for the catchments of 31 N2K or SSSI sites that are impacted by diffuse pollution.  This outputs consists of three layers 1) Erosion risk - This is a measure of the relative risk of sediment mobilisation and delivery 2) In-channel concentration risk - this is a measure of the relative risk of erosion leading to an increase in sediment concentration in the watercourse 3) Network Index - a relative measure of hydrological connectivity and propensity to generate overland flow.  For each of the 31 N2K or SSSI site catchments the model was run at a resolution of 5m.  However for larger catchments 5m resolution could only be run at a sub catchment level, with whole catchment run at a lower resolution (of either 10m, 15m 20m or 25m depending on the size of the catchment.)

Estimates of mean values within selected habitats and parent material characteristics across GB were made using Countryside Survey (CS) data from 1978, 1998 and 2007 using a mixed model approach. The estimated means of habitat/parent material combinations are modelled on dominant habitat and parent material characteristics derived from the Land Cover Map 2007 and Parent Material Model 2009, respectively. The parent material characteristic used was that which minimised AIC in each model (see Dataset Documentation). Please see Scott, 2008 for further details of similar statistical analysis (http://www.countrysidesurvey.org.uk/outputs/technical-reports). Areas, such as urban and littoral rock, are not sampled by CS and therefore have no associated data. Also, in some circumstances sample sizes for particular habitat / parent material combinations were insufficient to estimate mean values.", "lineage": "Data used are taken from the Countryside Survey Soils Report (Emmett et al. 2010) which can be found at http://www.countrysidesurvey.org.uk/outputs/technical-reports.

The project was intended to help underpin the State of the Seas report and to help manage the anthropogenic changes in the marine environment. This was part of a large scale sampling programme around the UK, spanning 2000-2009.Most of the sampling was conducted aboard the RV *Cefas Endeavour* using a variety of methods deemed compatible with the sedimentary habitat being targeted. At each station three replicate samples was collected, all within close proximity of each other. From each sample, a sub-sample of sediment was removed for sediment particle size distribution analysis. Macrofauna were extracted by sieving the collected sediments and viewing the residue under light magnification. Animals were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and each taxon enumerated and weighed.Tidal parameters were generated using a 3D hydrodynamic model (Davies and Aldridge, 1993), run in depth-integrated form on an approximately 3.5 km resolution grid covering the European continental shelf. Average and peak wave stress were calculated from a one-year model run covering the period September 1999 to September 2000, on an approximately 12km grid, using the WAM spectral wave model run at the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory.Surface chlorophyll a concentration images, derived from MERIS satellite ocean colour data using the Chlorophyll-II algorithm for case-II waters (Doerffer and Schiller, 2007), were used to derive mean surface chlorophyll a concentrations between 2002 and 07Productivity estimates (i.e., P:B ratio (yr-1) and total production (kJ m-2 yr-1)) were derived in a stepwise approach from the raw abundance and biomass data (for Objective 5).

The loch has a single narrow connection to the sea, through which sea water enters at high tides. Salinity, temperature and depth measurements were taken throughout the loch and revealed the presence of a distinct halocline and thermocline in the north basin of the loch at about 4 m depth, neither of which were present in the south basin. The salinity of the water above the halocline in the north basin and throughout the south basin was 13 - 14 ppt whilst that below the halocline had a maximum of 28.5 ppt. Temperature decreased by approximately 1 degree Centigrade at the level of the halocline and rose again by approximately 0.5 degree Centigrade near the bottom of the loch. The flora and fauna were investigated both by diving and by shore collections. Two distinct communities of plants and animals were found in the loch: i) A 'freshwater ' marginal component consisting of freshwater euryhaline species and true brackish water species found above the halocline in the north basin and throughout the south basin of the loch. ii) A marine component consisting of marine euryhaline species numerically dominated by the red alga Phyllophora pseudoceranoides and the tunicates Ciona intestinalis and Ascidiella aspersa. Comparisons are made with other studies of brackish lochs and waters and it is concluded that Loch Obisary is an interesting and unusual example of this scarce habitat type.", "lineage": "This survey was extracted from a Marine Recorder snapshot."}

Also, public concern over the inadequacy of sewage disposal facilities in the Yarmouth area. At present, thirty outfalls discharge crude sewage into the lower River Bure, causing some organic enrichment to the lower River Bure. The survey was carried out in the first week in June 1987. Eight sites were sampled with a cylindrical corer (15cms diam by 20cms deep). Three replicates were taken from the mid horizontal distance point between high and low tides. Cores were taken soon after low water on each occassion. A sub sample from each sample was taken for sediment analysis, the remainder was sieved through a 500 micron sieve. The survey suggests sewage enrichment of the lower estuary increases the productivity but does not adversely affect the species diversity. It was also postulated that much of the mercury discharged through the Norwich sewage works during the previous twenty years has accumulated in the sediments of Breydon Water. The estuary was found to support a healthy, but undiverse invertebrate fauna. The lack of diversity was thought to be due to the homogeneity of the sediment types and the lack of extremes of salinity within Breydon Water. Breydon Water satisfied the biological, chemical, and aesthetic criteria for a class A estuary under the UK Estuarine Classification Scheme. Breydon Water is important as an over-wintering ground for waders, wildfowl and gulls.", "lineage": "This survey was extracted from a Marine Recorder snapshot."}

These data show the location of opportunities for hydropower and the basic environmental sensitivity associated with exploiting them in England and Wales. A total of 25,935 barriers are identified and assessed in this project. The term barriers is used to describe sites with sufficient drop to provide a hydropower opportunity. They are mostly weirs, but could also be other man-made structures or natural features, such as waterfalls. The average maximum power generation capacity on a barrier was 45Kw, with a total potential capacity of 1178Mw. Environmental sensitivities were assessed. This assessment considered the presence of fish species and whether the site has been designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). Almost half (46%) of these barriers are classified as highly sensitive, mostly because of the presence of migratory fish species such as salmon and eel. 27% are medium and high sensitivity, and the remainder are unclassified due to a lack of data. When it is assumed that a new scheme has a fish pass built into it, the environmentally compatible opportunities increase considerably. A filtered dataset is also available based on potential power output and environmental sensitivity, AfA206 'Potential Sites of Hydropower Opportunity - filtered'. Given the scale of the project and the data used, the results are not intended to replace any part of an individual site assessment. Instead, the dataset gives national and regional level overviews of the potential opportunities available, their locations, and their relative environmental sensitivity to exploitation. INFORMATION WARNING These data are intended to provide national and regional overviews of the potential hydropower opportunities available, their locations, and their relative environmental sensitivity to exploitation. At site-level, there will be some error inherent in the results as the map uses a national GIS dataset that is based on various sources. One-third of the sites where older Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data was used for the height estimate include an error of up to one metre. The remaining two-thirds use Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), which is accurate to 25cm. This means that the data for an individual site may be inaccurate, but at the national and regional level the error will be averaged out to an extent. There is not a high level of confidence in the power generation calculation. The power category takes account of this uncertainty.

This product shows the likely locations and boundaries of dune slacks for sites around England. A dune slack is a depression in coastal dune system.It is based upon a morphological definition of dune slacks and uses LIDAR Digital Terrain Model (DTM) data and a derived slope model. Each slack has height statistics calculated for it. The data are provided in Polygon Shapefile format. Geographical coverage is incomplete because of limits in data available. It includes those areas where the Environment Agency, Natural England and the Regional Coastal Monitoring Programme have carried out sufficient aerial and ground surveys.

INFORMATION WARNING This product shows likely locations of dune slacks using a morphological definition. Dune slack boundaries based upon phytological associations may differ to this product. This is particularly important to remember where sand dunes are covered by large extents of scrub or woodland, as through the use of the LIDAR DTM, slacks can be identified under scrub and tree vegetation. However this also gives the product unique advantages in considering vegetation recovery after scrub or tree clearance.", "lineage": "Dune slacks were identified using LiDAR derived products. These include a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Slope model. To identify and locate dune slacks we defined them morphologically. This definition was then used to set conditions which would identify potential dune slacks within the boundaries of the dune system and remove areas that were unlikely. Height statistics derived from the DTM were then used to remove slacks that did not meet set conditions. The areas resulting are therefore likely to be dune slacks. Critical evaluation was then carried out with edits being made to create the final product."}

As a precautionary measure to safeguard marine top predators, particularly seabirds at internationally important colonies in and around the Firth of Forth, an area off the east coast of Scotland, from Rattray Head to St Abbs, was closed to industrial fishing for sandeels in 2000. High levels of recruitment in 1999 and 2000, combined with a lack of any significant fishing activity in 1999, resulted in an immediate and substantial increase in the biomass of sandeels on the Wee Bankie grounds in 2000; the first year of the sandeel closure. Since 2001, sandeel biomass has steadily declined to levels in 2007 that were similar to those observed in 1997 and 1998 when the sandeel fishery in the area was active. In the absence of sustained recruitment, consumption by marine top predators, along with other causes of natural mortality, have exceeded growth production in the population. Closing the area to fishing has not been sufficient to ensure high abundances of sandeels in the area. Recruitment of young sandeels, at or above long-term average levels, is also necessary, and since this is primarily governed by natural process, this may be beyond the capacity of fisheries management alone to achieve. Variation in the abundance and feeding ecology of gadoid predators in the study area was unrelated to variation in sandeel abundance and so remained unaffected by closure of the fishery. Numbers of guillemots, razorbills, puffins and kittiwakes recorded at sea in the study area all appeared to increase with closure of the fishery, and then subsequently to decline again as local sandeel abundance declined. The increase in auk abundance at sea may well have resulted from an influx of non-breeding birds. Only the breeding performance of kittiwakes at the Isle of May appeared related to variation in local sandeel abundance. Simply closing offshore areas close to top predator colonies may not be sufficient to guarantee the long term prospects of predators at these locations.", "lineage": "The study area covered most of two ICES statistical rectangles, 41E7 and 41E8, between latitudes 56o 00N and 56o 30N and longitudes 003o 00W and 001o 00W (Figure 3.1).

Modelled fluvial flood depth and climate change depth difference data* was created for both the 0.1% annual chance of flooding situations and was produced as a by-product from the 2004 generalised modelling project. The purpose of the generalised modelling project was to fill the gaps where there was no detailed local modelled data in 2004, in order to define the extents of Flood Zones for spatial planning. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model called JFlow was used to produce both the modelled fluvial flood depth and modelled fluvial flood depth with climate change data. This depth difference data, using these 2 datasets, is provided on a 5x5m grid. Since 2004, some local detailed modelling projects have included scenarios for climate change however this depth difference dataset has not been updated.

This large amount of noise may cause harmful damage to marine mammals in the near vicinity. This study examines the potential to create deterrent noise to move marine mammals away from the source of the damaging noise to prevent any injury.", "lineage": "A number of anthropogenic activities that occur in coastal and offshore waters generate soundor impulses at levels which are sufficiently high to pose a risk of causing physical damage orhearing impairment in sensitive wildlife such as marine mammals. The use of explosives, forexample, for well-head removal, certainly poses this risk and it is possible that pile drivingduring windfarm construction could also do so. One potential means of reducing the risk ofdamage to marine mammals from such activities is to move sensitive animals out of the highrisk area by using aversive or alarming sounds produced by an acoustic mitigation device(AMD). This report investigates the potential for using AMDs for mitigation during windfarmconstruction, explores the types of acoustic signals that might be suitable for this application,and the devices available for producing them in the field. It makes recommendations in relationto the areas of research that would be needed to develop and quantify the performance of aworking system, and reviews legal aspects of using AMDs for mitigation in UK waters.In the absence of clear criteria from regulators in the UK or Europe for unacceptable exposure,we have worked to two acoustic exposure thresholds proposed by NOAA in the USA. These arethat received levels for a single pulse should not exceed 180 dB re 1HPa for cetaceans and 190dBfor seals, and the cumulative exposure should not exceed 195 dB re 1HPa2s. A cumulativeexposure model which accounts for animal movements and propagation conditions as well assource levels and duty cycles of piling activities and AMDs was used to explore the ranges towhich animals would need to be moved to minimise the risk that these thresholds for acceptablenoise exposure would be exceeded. Ranges varied widely between different likely scenarios. Inpart this reflects sensitivity to factors such as propagation conditions which vary between sitesand with conditions, but which could be measured and more tightly defined in the model.However it is also the consequence of some fundamental unknowns, such as the behaviour ofanimals when exposed to aversive sounds and piling. The results from this modelling exerciseshould not be used to make firm predictions, but they do indicate that, whilst the risk of hearingdamage to marine mammals from piling activities cannot be discounted, it could be greatlyreduced if animals were induced to move out of the area before piling started. In typicalconditions animals would need to be moved over ranges of hundreds or low thousands ofmetres to achieve this, and this sets indicative performance criteria for an effective AMD"}

The analysis was done by Management Areas; A, B and C.", "lineage": "The positions of the survey sites were based on previous survey positions from surveys carried out by Cefas/ Cornwall Council prior to Cornwall IFCA taking over management of the fishery in 2014.  The survey was carried out onboard research vessel Tiger Lily VI. The oyster dredge used was an Essex-style oyster dredge with a 72 cm blade, rigged with 34 mm diameter steel belly rings and a 45 mm (twin 3 mm nylon twine) mesh back. The dredge was deployed and recovered using the A frame on the stern of Tiger Lily VI.  A target was created in Olex for each site position and a radius ring was added to ensure each tow was 50 m in length. A tow haul method was adopted, similar to that used by the oyster punts. This allowed the dredge tow to be of a known distance and to be easily and consistently replicated. At each survey site the survey vessel was anchored and 60 m of anchor line was let out. The dredge was shot by hand and the slave hauler winch was used to take up 50 m of marked anchor line, resulting in a 50 m dredge tow at a steady 0.5 to 1 knots. The towing warp was run via the A frame mounted hydraulic winch. The towing warp was marked off so that the length (m) of cable deployed at any time was known; this was generally fixed for an average depth and altered only if a depth change was sufficient to cause the dredge to fish too heavily or lightly. The dredge was recovered using the hydraulic winch and/ or A frame.  Once recovered, the dredge contents were emptied on to the sorting table. If the dredge did not fish, due to being blinded or flipped over, or the sample appeared smaller than it should be for particular areas, the dredge haul was repeated. A target was created in HYPACK MAX to indicate the start of line (SOL) and end of line (EOL). All positions were recorded using WGS84 projection and all times are recorded as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  Each sample was photographed on the sorting table alongside a clapper board prior to sorting. Live native oysters, queen scallops and slipper limpets were removed and set aside as the sample was sorted.  All live oysters and queen scallops were counted and measured across the widest point, to the nearest mm using Vernier callipers. The weight (g) was recorded for oysters where possible to the nearest 0.1g. All slipper limpets were counted, as individuals and as part of a chain.  Observations of the catch composition (substrate) were recorded for each dredge sample.

The study area is located within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in the southeast Pacific, Drake Passage and Scotia Sea regions of the Southern Ocean. Data collection began in December 2009 and ended in April 2014. The data were collected via a combination of research cruises in the southern hemisphere summer seasons. Three cruises were intended (UKD-1, UKD-2 and UKD-3) a further three cruises were completed (UKD-2.5, UKD-4 and UKD-5). Shipboard data collection involved the deployment of conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) packages, accompanied by lowered acoustic Doppler current profilers (LADCPs), and Vertical Microstructure Profilers (VMPs) in a grid pattern across the study area. Continuous measurements of current velocities (using vessel mounted ADCPs, VMADCPs), bathymetry and surface ocean and meteorological properties were collected throughout each cruise. An inert chemical tracer (sulphur hexafluoride, SF6) was released into the ACC in early 2009, and subsequent cruises measured temporal changes in the tracer distribution via the analysis of water samples collected at CTD stations. In addition, a mooring cluster was deployed in Drake Passage in early 2009 provided approximately two years' worth of hydrographic time series data. Floats and drifters were also deployed in the 2009 and 2010 seasons. The DIMES project aims to enhance understanding of mixing processes in the Southern Ocean, as it is thought that such processes may significantly affect ocean energetics and property balances, and thus have implications for the accuracy of climate models.

The indicator is focused on the availability of data collated by the National Biodiversity Network for decision making - evaluating actual use within decision making is more difficult.Millions of biological observations (records) have been recorded in the UK over the past century by a wide variety of organisations and individuals.  Most of these people are volunteers who organise themselves through many national and local societies and recording schemes.

The first process produced the GIBC 01 - Typology & Functionality OS dataset. This dataset is then subsequently used as a  basis for the production of the second, third and fourth datasets during the second stage.In the first stage each OS polygon was assigned a green infrastructure category based on the SPADES project from the list below.

Shows areas whereby the function has been met. Shows areas whereby the function has not been met.Second Stage ProcessingThe second stage expands on the first by establishing which areas suffer from stress associated with investment in growth and redevelopment of land. These areas are known as pinch points. Wherever there is a high level of need for a particular function (identified in the first process), a potential pinch point exists. The pinch point categories that have been identified are: Air Quality Pinch Culture Pinch Flooding Pinch Heat Stress Pinch Heritage Pinch Local Community Pinch Mental Health Pinch Nature Pinch Physical Activity Pinch Recreation Pinch Sustainable Travel PinchThe second dataset, GIBC 02  Pinch Points OS, takes the analysis from the first stage process and using the Ordnance Survey data as a base layer, displays the pinch points analysis results. The third dataset, GIBC 03  Pinch Points Consortium Housing, takes the analysis from the first stage process and rather than using the OS as a base uses the Consortium Housing Site data instead to display pinch points.The fourth dataset, GIBC 04  Pinch Points Housing Land Availability, takes the analysis from the first stage process and rather than using the OS as a base used the Strategic Housing Land Availability data instead to display pinch points.ConclusionThe pinch point mapping can help identify particular areas of stress, which when used in conjunction with the green infrastructure and function mapping from the first stage process can be used to help alleviate those stresses.", "lineage": "Please see green infrastructure mapping method document and pinch points mapping explanation document"}

They broadly cover the European Shelf with some data from the Iberian Abyssal Plain. Data were collected using the lowered CTD rosette system which is used when the vessel is stationary. Usually bottles were fired at particular depths and samples taken for calibration. In early years only a limited set of parameters were collected. Notably Pressure (Depth), Temperature and Conductivity (CTD). From Conductivity Salinity can be calculated using the UNESCO 1978,1983 formulations . In subsequent years more sensors have been added, notably fluorometers, Optical back scatter or transmissometers and Light (PAR, photo synthetically available radiation). The exact configuration varies between cruises and this is reflected in the data format of the output files.Data was collected from research vessels on station, a profile from the surface to near the sea bed is undertaken. The down cast data should be a clean profile. Water bottles for sample collection and calibration are fired on the up cast.", "lineage": "Data was collected via the CTD rosette system using either a Guildine CTD or from approximately 1993 an Falmouth Scientific Instruments Integrated CTD. In addition to the CTD, additional instruments are Sea Point Fluorometers, Dr Haardt Fluorometers, Transmissometers, Sea Point Optical Backscatter, LICOR Light Sensors (PAR)Instruments were usually calibrated where possible before the cruise and post cruise, in a water bath, for Temperature and using a pressure test vessel for pressure. Calibrations for Salinity were performed with reference to Salinity samples collected. Calibration of the fluorescence to generate chlorophyll was by comparison to the collected samples. Similarly suspend load would be calibrated to samples collected and filtered. The light sensor was calibrated in a dark light box. The specific calibration values (where available) are stored with each cruise data set.Processing of the data was initially performed using the instrument specific programs to generate ASCII files (e.g FSIpost) a suite of programs developed at CEFAS was then used to generate calibrated files and generate the processed information.High resolution data is stored as .txt files where possible, however as not all calibrated high resolution data is available processed, the original data files (binary - *.raw, *.edt, *.hdr *.

They broadly cover the European Shelf with some data from the Iberian Abyssal Plain. Data were collected using the lowered CTD rosette system which is used when the vessel is stationary. Usually bottles were fired at particular depths and samples taken for calibration. In early years only a limited set of parameters were collected. Notably Pressure (Depth), Temperature and Conductivity (CTD). From Conductivity Salinity can be calculated using the UNESCO 1978,1983 formulations . In subsequent years more sensors have been added, notably fluorometers, Optical back scatter or transmissometers and Light (PAR, photo synthetically available radiation). The exact configuration varies between cruises and this is reflected in the data format of the output files.Data was collected from research vessels on station, a profile from the surface to near the sea bed is undertaken. The down cast data should be a clean profile.

Calibrations for Salinity were performed with reference to Salinity samples collected. Calibration of the fluorescence to generate chlorophyll was by comparison to the collected samples. Similarly suspend load would be calibrated to samples collected and filtered. The light sensor was calibrated in a dark light box. The specific calibration values (where available) are stored with each cruise data set.Processing of the data was initially performed using the instrument specific programs to generate ASCII files (e.g FSIpost) a suite of programs developed at CEFAS was then used to generate calibrated files and generate the processed information.+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|Pres |DBAR |Pressure in Dbar |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|Temp |Deg C |Temperature in Celsius |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|SALT | |Salinity (PSS 78) |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|PTEMP |Deg C |Potential Temperature |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|SNDVEL |m/sec |Sound Velocity |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|SIG-TH |KG/m3 |Density Sigma theta |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|SIGM |KG/m3 |Density Sigma T |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|SVAN |10*8 |Specific Volume Anomaly |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|DYNHT |m |Dynamic Height |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|BVF |CPH |Brunt Vaisala Frequency |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|Depth |m |Depth (integrated from density) |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|Transmission|raw | || |volts | |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|Susp Load |mg/l |Calibrated transmission (or || | |OBS) |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|RADI |lng A |raw light sensor |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|PAR |uE/M2/S |Calibrated light |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|Fluor |Volt |Uncalibrated fluorometer |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+|Chl |mg/m3 |Calibrated fluorometer |+------------+---------+--------------------------------+"}

This species is commercially valuable and has been targeted by fisheries for over a century; however, fisheries in Wales and beyond have seen a steep decline in landings since the 1960s which coincided with the introduction of net fisheries for this species. The crawfish is a priority species for the UK Biodiversity Action Plan and is also an important component of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) designated for rocky reefs. It has been identified by the National Assembly for Wales as one of the species of 'principle importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity' in Wales and is listed in the Natural Environment Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006. This act requires that steps be taken that are 'reasonably practicable to further the conservation of the living organisms' listed and to 'promote the taking by others of such steps'. It is therefore important to understand the potential impact of fisheries management measures and other management measures on the recovery of this species both in designated areas and within the wider context of Welsh waters as a whole including the potential impact of regulations or management measures in adjacent waters. The purpose of this data capture was to investigate management measures for the self-propagated future recovery of crawfish Palinurus elephas in Welsh waters. The overall aim of this survey and reporting work was to establish the potential effectiveness of existing and possible management measures (both fishery and nature conservation based) to enable self-propagated recovery of P. elephas populations in Welsh waters within the context of their declined status. This was to be carried out through a review of relevant literature on this and other crustacean species to determine using the best available data and information the potential benefit of the different management measures.", "lineage": "In order to assess the potential effectiveness of existing and potential management measures for the recovery of Welsh populations of P elephas a review of available information has been carried out in the form of a literature review, including grey literature, and through liaison with persons with specific relevant expertise.

Where direct examples are not available, comparisons are drawn and aspects of the biology of P. elephas are interpreted with regards to the specific management measure in question. Where relevant management measures are applied in adjacent areas with the potential to aid recovery in Welsh waters, these are also included. The limitations of each management measure in aiding the potential recovery of crawfish populations in Welsh waters are also discussed.

Countryside Survey topsoil carbon data is representative of 0-15 cm soil depth and includes Loss-on-ignition (%), Carbon concentration (g kg-1) and Carbon density (t ha-1). A total of 2614 cores from 591 1km x 1km squares across Great Britain were collected and analysed in 2007 (see Emmett et al. 2010 for further details of sampling and methods http://www.countrysidesurvey.org.uk/outputs/technical-reports). Loss-on-ignition (LOI) was determined by combustion of 10g dry soil at 375 deg C for 16 hours; carbon concentration was estimated by multiplying LOI by a factor of 0.55, and carbon density was estimated by combining carbon concentration with bulk density estimates. The estimated means of habitat/parent material combinations using 2007 data are modelled on dominant habitat and parent material characteristics derived from the Land Cover Map 2007 and Parent Material Model 2009, respectively. The parent material characteristic used was that which minimised AIC in each model (see Supporting Information). Areas, such as urban and littoral rock, are not sampled by CS and therefore have no associated data. Also, in some circumstances sample sizes for particular habitat/parent material combinations were insufficient to estimate mean values.

Multibeam bathymetry data processed with the Caraibes software (v3.9) and a 30m grid created.The data was acquired in 1995 when multibeam systems were first emerging onto the commercial market. The number of beams per ping was limited and thus the data density low in comparison to more modern data. Data editting was only done on data that was significantly in error. The multibeam backscatter data was also processed in the Caraibes software package and produced 2 mosaics at 50m resolution. The backscatter data did not have higher resolution data. Correlation with ground truth data, consisting of sediment samples and photographic imagery samples, predominantly toward the top of slope and seamount summit and flanks,allowed basic interpretation of the bathymetry and backscatter data near the sample locations. To aid interpetation, the sediment samples had been divided into FOLK categoriesand habitat type determinations, as well as faunal communities in some instances, had beeen made for the photographic imagery samples.Characterisation was spread over the whole area and divided into polygon regions by finding interpretive boundaries on either backscatter imagery (such as texture changes or contrast changes) or on the bathymetric layers of slope, rugosity and relief.Derived using acoustic data supplied by Ifremer (FR).Additional information source:Sotheran, I., Benson, A. &amp; Crawford-Avis, O., (2014), Mapping habitats and biotopes from acoustic datasets to strengthen the information base of Marine Protected Areas in Scottish waters \u2013 Phase 2 (Barra Fan and Hebrides Terrace Seamount Area), JNCC Report 527, ISSN 0963 8901", "lineage": "Associated datasets: GB200045-48"}

The Sensitive Catchment Integrated Modelling Analysis Platform (SCIMAP) is a sediment risk assessment model which uses a digital terrain elevation, land use or land cover data and rainfall data to give an indication of where the relative risk of sediment erosion and delivery to a watercourse is greatest in a catchment. This model was run for the catchments of 31 N2K or SSSI sites that are impacted by diffuse pollution.  This outputs consists of three layers 1) Erosion risk - This is a measure of the relative risk of sediment mobilisation and delivery 2) In-channel concentration risk - this is a measure of the relative risk of erosion leading to an increase in sediment concentration in the watercourse 3) Network Index - a relative measure of hydrological connectivity and propensity to generate overland flow.  For each of the 31 N2K or SSSI site catchments the model was run at a resolution of 5m.

The forage fish populations inhabiting these waters provide a key source of prey for many predators, such as marine mammal and seabird species, including several of conservation concern, that either breed or overwinter in the study area. Given that several forage fish species in the northeast Atlantic have shown major changes in distribution and abundance, up-to-date information on their recent distribution patterns is important, including on where the main nursery and spawning grounds are presently located. The maps are provided for eleven fish species that are prey to marine mammals and seabirds: herring, sprat, sardine, anchovy, sandeel, horse mackerel, mackerel and garfish as well as the gadoid species poor cod, whiting and cod. Using survey data from 2008 to 2020, hotspot maps were created for adults and juveniles of each of the species. Data on most of the species was sparse and some of the gears used in fisheries surveys were not designed to catch the target species. However, a hotspot methodology allowed data from different gears to be standardised and combined into a composite map which covered most of the study area during two periods of the year (Quarter 1 and Quarter 4). Maps largely corresponded to those previously reported although several new species were included for which no or limited historic maps were available, specifically sprat, poor cod and garfish.", "lineage": "The focus of this study was spawning and nursery areas of forage fish in Welsh waters and surrounding shelf sea waters of the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and the western English Channel. Publicly available data from international fisheries-independent surveys were supplemented by data collected on surveys by Cefas.Data from three different types of surveys were considered for this study: pelagic (acoustic), demersal otter trawl (also referred to as bottom trawl) and beam trawl surveys. The available surveys included in this study covered two periods, between February and April and between September and December. To ensure the largest possible spatial coverage, surveys in either period were pooled and termed Quarter 1 and Quarter 4. Distribution of juveniles in both Quarters (chapter 4) was considered representative of the nursery grounds for the species. However, the distribution of adult fish was only assumed to represent spawning areas during the Quarter that coincided with the spawning period. For some species the peak spawning periods fell outside the survey periods in which case no spawning maps could be produced. However, the adult fish distribution maps during both Quarters were included in this report. The survey data used in this work are limited to waters more than ~20 m deep and the maps of the spawning and nursery areas in this report are therefore not representative of estuarine and transitional waters. as the catchability of species varies by survey and, particularly, gear type, averaging the species abundance data from different surveys, would not have been appropriate. To compensate for differences between surveys in gear selectivity, we created distribution maps for each species and size category by using a hotspot approach. This was based on a threshold, applied to the abundance data for each survey year separately. For each species and size category, these binary hotspot maps were then averaged across the surveys and years within a period (Quarter). A full description of the hotspot methodology used can be found in Campanella and van der Kooij (2021) (`https://waleslink.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1.-Spawning-and-nursery-grounds-of-forage-fish_CEFAS-project-report-for-RSPB.pdf`_).. _`https://waleslink.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1.-spawning-and-nursery-grounds-of-forage-fish_cefas-project-report-for-rspb.pdf`: https://waleslink.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1.-Spawning-and-nursery-grounds-of-forage-fish_CEFAS-project-report-for-RSPB.pdf"}

ICP Forests was mandated to monitor air pollution effects on forests and to contribute to a better understanding of cause-effect relationships.  Within the complex of anthropogenic and natural stresses, air pollution continues to be regards as an important stress factor. Air pollution and its effects on forest ecosystems are complex and difficult to isolate and quantify. A large number of other stress factors also have an influence on forest condition and must therefore be taken into consideration. The objective of the Level II network was therefore: to contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between the condition of the forest ecosystems and anthropogenic factors (in particular air pollution) as well as natural stress factors through intensive monitoring on a number of selected permanent observation plots spread over Europe and to study the development of important forest ecosystems in Europe.

This assessment of the condition of Scotlands seas has been based on scientific evidence from data and analysis, supported by expert judgement.Climate Change and Ocean AcidificationThe climate shows considerable variation over short and long timescales. However, in recent years there has been a marked increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere of the Earth and, at the same time, sea surface temperature has risen as have sea levels. Changes in the biological components of the seas have been observed including earlier plankton blooms, a northward movement of some species and a reductionin seabird populations, all of which have been linked to climate change.At the same time, the seas are becoming more acidic, the consequences of which, especially for calcareous organisms, could be significant. Reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases are required and Scotland has set ambitious targets. However, even with such reductions, it is highly likely that further impacts of climate change on the marine environment will be observed.Clean and SafeScotlands seas are mainly clean and safe, although there are some localised areas where there is contamination or hazards to human health. For example, sediments in several harbours and estuaries remain contaminated with hazardous substances, a legacy of past industrial discharges. Water quality in the Forth and Clyde estuaries is compromised by discharges of industrial effluent and treated sewage although effluent treatment hasimproved resulting in returning populations of residential and migratory fish. The use of historical contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and tributyl tin (TBT) has been banned, and monitoring continues to assess their continued environmental decline.Information is being gathered on a range of other contaminants, including endocrine disrupters and brominated flame retardants, to assess their environmental impacts. Diffuse inputs of nutrients and bacteria have given rise, respectively, to some localised issues in small east coast estuaries and at bathing beaches. Action plans have been put in place to tackle these issues. Concerns such as marine litter and underwater noise havebecome more broadly recognised and will be addressed through the operational response to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Generally the effects of noise remain unquantified and unknown.Healthy and Biologically DiverseScotlands seas support a diverse array of habitats and species and contain nationally and internationally important populations of certain species such as the northern feather star, the burrowing sea anemone, the northern sea fan and cold water corals.There is evidence that certain habitats have been impacted, for example shallow and shelf subtidal sediments (including burrowed mud habitats). This stems largely from the effects of fishing over large areas of the seabed and more localised impacts from activities such as aquaculture.The low abundance of some demersal commercial fish species across the west coast of Scotland is a major concern and is being addressed through various initiatives. Improved knowledge of fishing activity and its impact on the marine environment would be beneficial.Establishment of new fisheries should only be undertaken following careful assessment of the viability and future sustainability of the fishery, especially given the sensitivity of some, particularly deep water, species to fishing and against a background of historic over-exploitation.Sharks, skates and rays face further declines and are severely depleted all around the coast, although the number of sightings of basking sharks has increased in recent years especially in the Minches and Malin Sea. These declines are largely the consequence of historically unsustainable catches in both target and non-target fisheries and their long-lived, very low fecundity life cycle. Many of these, for example, porbeagle andcommon skate, can no longer be targeted commercially.Populations of some seabirds, harbour seals and some fish species have declined. Possible reasons include climate change, a number of different human activities and competition from other species. These declines may be associated with broader changes in the food web. For example, the decline in availability of sandeels has had a major influence on recent changes in seabird numbers on the east coast and in the Northern Isles.Although, in general, the current assessment for cetaceans suggests there are no specific concerns, this has been made against a background of a very high level of uncertainty and little power to detect concerns if they currently exist.ProductiveScotlands seas are economically productive. Official figures show that the core marine sector, less the extraction of oil and gas, contributed 3.6 billion of Gross Value Added (GVA) in 2008 (at 2009 prices), about 3.5% of overall Scottish GVA. About 39,800 people were employed, 1.6% of Scottish employment. The extraction of oil and gas had a GVA of 13.3 billion in 2007 (at 2009 prices). Fishing takes place in all Scottish sea areas but some, such as Hebrides, North Scotland Coast and East and West Shetland, are far more economically productive than others. Aquaculture, both finfish and shellfish, predominates on the west coast and the islands.Sixteen major ports handle about 98% of all port traffic with liquid bulk, mainly oil and gas, accounting for 69%. There is significant commercial shipping both to ports and for transit through Scottish waters, as well as domestic and international ferry activity. The seas are also used extensively by the Royal Navy and other armed forces, for exercises and operations, sometimes including international partners.Other activities include cooling water abstraction for power stations and the disposal of treated urban waste water, industrial effluent and dredge spoil. Seabed telecommunications cables carry millions of internet and phone call connections, thereby providing a major communications network.The seas are also used for leisure and recreation, particularly sailing, angling and other sporting activities. Scotlands historic environment and natural and cultural heritage attract many tourists.The enormous potential of marine renewable energy generation from offshore wind, waves and tides has started to be harnessed. There is also potential for storage of carbon dioxide under the seabed, in carbon capture and storage schemes.Also see http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/345830/0115128.pdf for maps and further details.", "lineage": "Aim of Scotlands Marine AtlasThe first Marine Atlas presents data spatially to assist with the introduction of marine planning. It does so based around the elements of the governments vision for the sea: clean and safe, healthy and biologically diverse and productive.The Atlas presents the assessment of condition and summary of significant pressures and the impacts of humanactivity required for the national marine plan. It also represents a contribution to the initial assessment required for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD)(1) by July 2012.Area covered and scale of dataThe Marine (Scotland) Act 2010(2) and the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2 009(3) provide for marine planning of Scottish waters out to 200 nautical miles and give new marine conservation responsibilities. So this Atlas presents data over this whole area, including for policy areas which are reserved to Westminster, to ensure that policies developed in the national marine plan are informed by the fullest data possible. The Atlas refers to avariety of boundaries and spatial scales: \u0122 200 nautical miles  the maximum limit for fisheries and renewable energy powers. Marine planning and natureconservation powers can extend further.\u0122 12 nautical mile territorial sea  limit of Scotland as defined in the Scotland Act.\u0122 3 nautical miles - the limit to which Water Framework Directive measures have been implemented in Scotland.Data can be aggregated to different scales for different purposes, so its presentation has to consider the purpose.This Atlas presents data at the most relevant scale available to illustrate the main issues for national marine planning. There is provision for future marine plans to be developed for Scottish marine regions. These regions have yet to be decided. However, the 15 sea areas used in this Atlas, based on areas previously adopted for certain environmental monitoring programmes, are likely to be of a similar scale as marine regions.The data from these 15 areas can be presented regionally and also reasonably aggregated to form a national picture and to develop information for the two main areas required for the MSFD initial assessment: the Greater North Sea (Area II) and the Celtic Seas (Area III) which are existing sea areas used by OSPAR (the Oslo Paris Convention for the Protection of the North East Atlantic)(4).How this Atlas has been compiledThe Atlas has taken Scotlands Seas: Towards Understanding their State, published in 2008(5), and developed itscontents to provide a spatial assessment where possible. Much effort has been taken to map data sets and present graphs around them. It is recognised that there are some areas where this is not yet possible so the provision of spatial data suitable for marine planning will be an evolutionary process. A data annex available online, lists the various data sources used for this Atlas.The preparation of the Atlas has been a collaborative effort. Marine Scotland led the work on chapters 2, 5 and 6,with SEPA in the lead for chapter 3 and SNH, with assistance from JNCC, leading chapter 4. Each contributor also developed the appropriate part of the overall assessment. A valuable contribution was also provided by the Marine Alliance for Science and Technology Scotland (MASTS)(6) to all work. The Agri-Food &amp; Biosciences Institute; Centre for Environment, Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture Science; Countryside Council for Wales; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; Environment Agency; National Oceanography Centre; Natural England and Northern Ireland Environment Agency all reviewed Atlas material.A variety of data sources have been used. The key data sets are from the range of established monitoring programmes undertaken by the various contributing organisations for their main responsibilities, for example, to meet legal obligations. For much of the productive seas data, existing data from regularly published government statistics have been used. Most data have required some re-working to be presented at the level ofthe sea areas used.Data used for Charting Progress 2 (CP2)(7), published in July 2010, have also been heavily relied on here. CP2 was the second assessment of the UK seas and involved the same contributing Scottish scientists as this Atlas. This Atlas draws on the four CP2 Feeder Reports adding more detail where necessary and appropriate to mapScottish seas.To make the Atlas easily accessible and to focus on portraying information spatially, the material has been restricted to summaries and short text, complimented by images and graphs. For many topics, further information isavailable from a variety of sources and these are referenced.

Farnella uses a trawl typical of the northern North Sea saithe fishery (headline height 4 m, door spread 110115 m codend mesh &gt;110 mm, tow speed 4 knots). Throughout, fishing took place in the northern North Sea, but for the most part focused on ICES Division IVa).Data collectionSelf samplingEstimating fish numbers and weightsThe skipper and crew were asked to provide estimates of the weight and number of retained and discarded cod and saithe of each size grade for every haul. At the end of each haul, fishroom staff provided the wheelhouse a tally recording the number of baskets per grade of cod and saithe caught. Baskets were estimated at 45 kg, and the numbers of fish in each basket were assessed regularly (to take into account the seasonal and spatial variations of fish condition).Biotic and abiotic measurementsAll cod were caught in every haul were measured, and a minimum of 100 saithe per size grade were measured per trip. When necessary (large hauls), saithe numbers were raised to haul level as a proportion of the total catch, using volume-based raising factors. All fish were measured to the nearest centimetre below (total length). Environmental conditions (sea state, wind strength/ direction) and physical conditions (depth, position, haul-duration and gear properties) were recorded along with the biological data.Observer samplingThree observer trips were conducted throughout the study period. The first observer trip, in May 2007, was used to train the skipper and crew of the Farnella in sampling methods. The second and third observer trips were used to maintain the standards applied from the start (there was skipper and crew turnover) and particularly to ensure that the self-sampling was of a very high standard. These second two observer trips were carried out in the first quarters of 2008 and 2009. Information collected from the trained observers was used to validate the data provided by the vessel and to provide a more detailed overview of the fishery with respect to bycatch and discards.Fish age determinationA total of 29 000 fish otoliths was removed at sea by observers and from fish landed to fish markets. Of these, 15 500 were from cod and 13 500 from saithe. All otoliths were extracted from fish that had been caught in ICES area IVa between April 2007 and March 2009 (the study period covered by this report). Otoliths were mounted, sectioned, stained, read, and re-read for quality control purposes, according to the protocols of Cefas and Marine Scotland - Marine Laboratory.Data analysisData handlingTrip, haul, length, catch and age data were entered onto a MS access database. All data entered were cross-checked against the paperwork and quality-controlled for inaccuracies. Data were handled using SPSS V17 statistical software, charts were produced using Sigmaplot V10.0, and maps were created in MapInfo V7.8.Converting fish length into fish agesAge-at-length data collected from the 15 500 cod and 13 500 saithe that were aged were used. Data were collected throughout the year to take into account length variations of a growing age class. At a given length in any quarter, fish age will vary. For example, in quarter 3 of 2007, 49 cod of the 70-cm length class were aged as between one and four years old, so when one 70-cm cod was observed and measured in quarter 3, it was aged proportionally to what was observed in the population. Each fish length has a different combination of proportions at a given age. If more than one fish was observed at a given length, then the number at length was multiplied by the proportion at age to give the estimated numbers at a given age. Age-length keys (ALKs) applied to this analysis are area- (ICES IVa), species- (cod or saithe) and season-specific (quarters 1, 2, 3 and 4). Sex is not taken into account. When a fish length could not be matched with a length that had been aged in a particular quarter, then seasonality was removed and an aggregated ALK for the whole year was used. This occurred in &lt;2% of the &gt;75 000 fish measured.Generating an age-category keyHaul data are presented in numbers of fish caught by category. In order to make use of this information and to evaluate the numbers-at-age of fish caught at a particular haul location, we need to understand the age spread of a particular category. Fishermen were asked to record the category of the fish measured. With each measurement we can assess the age of the fish, so an area, species and season age-category key can be generated. For example, in quarter 3 of 2007, an estimated 1 990 category 4 cod were caught. These were aged between 2 and 6 years old, so when a category 4 fish was caught (now disregarding length information) we applied the same method as an ALK and aged it proportionally using an age category key (ACK). For example, If 1000 category 4 cod were caught in a particular haul, we would estimate 533 to be age 2 (1000 x 0.533), 398 to be age 3 (1000 x 0.398), 66 to be age 4, etc.Calculating catch per unit effortThe total numbers of fish caught each month (by species) were divided by the total haul duration to determine the numbers of fish caught per hour, or the catch per unit effort (CPUE). This unit allowed the catch data to be standardised and used for comparative analysis.SummaryThe Northern North Sea Saithe (and Cod) FSP was established in response to an industry- and science-perceived absence of realistic data on the 2004 and 2005 year classes of saithe and the 2005 and 2006 year classes of cod. The 2005 and 2004 year classes of saithe (4 and 5 year olds) are of particular interest because they were predicted to contribute significantly to projected landings in 2008 and subsequently to contribute to the spawning-stock biomass of the species in 2009. This study uses data collected at haul level by fishermen aboard the commercial fishing vessel MFV Farnella over a two-year period. Throughout, fishing was widespread in the northern North Sea, but for the most part was focused on ICES Division IVa. The skipper and crew were trained in sampling techniques prior to collecting the data. and all information sent ashore was checked regularly. Observer-accompanied trips were also carried out to ensure a high standard of data quality. Between May 2007 and March 2009 (the study period) MFV Farnella embarked on 51 commercial fishing trips in the northern North Sea (ICES IVa), hauled 1154 times, and caught 3.3 million saithe (Pollachius virens) and 51 000 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Of the fish caught, the crew measured most of the cod (48 772) and 26 518 saithe (75 290 in total)."}

Fewer large fishes will reduce the amount of predation on smaller prey species and allow increases in their abundance and biomass. In turn this will affect the structure and stability of the ecosystem.  The indicator responds to fishing impacts on the fish community because larger fish are more likely to be caught by trawls and because larger species of fish are more likely to decline in number for a given rate of fishing.  When fish communities are more heavily fished, the proportion of large fish is expected to fall and, when fishing is reduced, the proportion of large fish is expected to rise.  Some variation in the proportion of large fish will be driven by environmental variation, but available evidence suggests environmental effects on this indicator are relatively small in relation to fishing effects over periods of a few years.The indicator shows changes in the proportion, by weight, of large individuals equal to or over 40cm in length in fish populations in the North-western part of the North Sea.  The indicator is based on standardised annual research survey trawls.  During the 1980s, large fish in the North Sea fish community included cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), saithe (Pollachius virens), ling (Molva molva), anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) and rays (Batoidea).  Recently, haddock have formed a substantial part of the large fish catches in the North-western North Sea, along with cod and saithe.

An underwater video and still photograph survey was conducted by Heriot-Watt University and SNH for MS between the 6th and 11th September 2011 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 74 sites within the Southern Trench shelf deep area. The images and infaunal samples, analysed under SNH contract by Heriot-Watt University, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. An infaunal grab survey was also undertaken on this survey at a subset of 20 drop-down video stations, selected to target areas of historic records of shelf deep habitat and where PMFs were most likely to occur with the overall aim of gaining a broader understanding of the habitat type and assist in biotope assignment.

Survey stations were chosen using a stratified random coarse grid pattern with a higher density of stations in most likely PMF areas. Video images were obtained from a combined total of 74 drop-down video drift tows deployed just above the seabed for 5-10mins. Still photographs were also taken approximately taken every minute manually. A Konsberg OE14-366 colour zoom camera was used alongside a Konsberg 14-208 digital stills camera, with camera and lights mounted onto a sled for this survey. Positional, time and depth data are available for the start and end of video runs. Analyses of the video footage was undertaken by Heriot-Watt University, contracted by SNH, to describe the physical structure and species assemblages present. Based on the physical and biological attributes, biotopes were allocated. Species present were identified and quantified using the semi-quantitative MNCR SACFOR scale for colonies and large aggregations of individuals, where possible, or using numerical abundance of individuals. Where video runs traversed a sequence of biotopes, the runs are split into corresponding segments with the transition points recorded using time. Segmentation of runs was not practicable in the case of mosaics of recurring biotopes, in which case all biotopes observed were simply listed. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence PMFs and MPA search features, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance. A small number of pre-planned sampling stations had to be removed due to a high number of creels obstructing the safe deployment of the drop-down video camera. Infaunal samples were collected at 20 stations in the Southern Trench survey area using a 0.1m2 Day grab. Sampling stations for grabs were selected based on a subset of drop-down video sampling stations so as to increase sampling effort in areas where PMFs were most likely to occur. Single sediment grabs were collected at each station to gain a broad understanding of the biotopes present on the seabed. A small sub sample of each grab was taken for particle size analysis (PSA), before being sieved by hand through a 1mm mesh size. Any material retained on the sieve was transferred to a labelled container before being fixed with a buffered 4% formaldehyde solution. A biotope was assigned to each grab sample. PSA and infaunal analysis was also undertaken by Heriot-Watt University."}

Great crested newts (GCN), alongside other species listed in Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive, are afforded particular protection because of their conservation status at a European scale. This species is widespread in Europe, but has declined since the 1940s. In the UK, GCN are widespread and locally common, with a patchy distribution, especially in South West England, parts of Wales, and in Scotland. A requirement of the Habitats Directive of each EU member state is to ensure that European Protected Species are maintained at or restored to favourable conservation status across their natural range. In order to better understand the conservation status of the species in England, a much better understanding is needed of the distribution and extent of the population of the species in its natural range, and the habitat available to it. This project forms part of a series of projects to produce an enhanced evidence base which can be used to inform decisions about land-use planning and determining conservation status.  It is the first of a two-stage exercise to collect data to develop a model for predicting the presence of GCN.  Potential applications of a predictive model could include earlier identification of areas where GCN can be ruled in or out as a concern in land-use planning decisions.

Images in adjacent locations were mosaicked with the image panorama generating software Autopano Giga 2.6, with a root mean square error (RMS) of less than 5 m where possible. Aerial images were then georeferenced in ArcMap10.0, using Ordnance Survey maps where features were readily visible both on the map and on the image. On occasion, images were georeferenced using aerial imagery that was already georeferenced. Accuracies of less than 5 m RMS was obtained. Georeferenced images were then rectified with the ArcMap10 Nearest Neighbour (for discrete data) function as uncompressed TIFFs, before compression to JPEG format with 100% image quality.

Present-day low-altitude imagery was captured with a time-lapse compact Canon camera (D10) with no flash and infinity focus. The camera was attached to either a kite or a helium balloon and led over the sites of interest. The resultant images were mosaicked with Autopano Giga 2.6 achieving the lowest RMS possible and visual clarity.

Sediment samples were taken from 6 riverine locations and five coastal ones. Samples were dried for 3 days (less than 50 degrees centigrade) and weighted. Density separation using NaCl solution and a centrifuge, filtering the supernatant. This was followed by a chemical digestion with a KOH:NaClO solution for 3 days at 50 degrees centigrade whilst shaking. Plastic particles were then stained with Nile Red dye and a digital image was acquired through a microscope. Microplastic particles were then counted and a subsample of particles (between 1 and 10 percent) was processed through a ATR\u2014FTIR to identify particle composition comparing their spectrum to a polymers library. The presence and number of particles of plastic more than 5mm was also noted for each sample."}

Bedrock geology describes the main mass of solid rocks forming the earth's crust. Bedrock is present everywhere, whether exposed at surface in outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits or water bodies. Geological names are based on the lithostratigraphic or lithodemic hierarchy. This means rock bodies are arranged into units based on rock-type and geological time of formation. Where rock-types do not fit into the lithostratigraphic scheme, for example intrusive, deformed rocks subjected to heat and pressure resulting in new or changed rock types; then their classification is based on their rock-type or lithological composition. This assesses visible features such as texture, structure, mineralogy. Data identifying linear features (shown as polylines) represent geological faults at the ground or bedrock surface (beneath superficial deposits).

The first return DSM will not match in coverage or extent the standard DSM composite which is produced from the last or only return as the last return DSM composite is produced from both the national LIDAR programme and Timeseries surveys. The data is available to download as GeoTiff rasters in 5km tiles aligned to the OS National grid. The data is presented in metres, referenced to Ordinance Survey Newlyn and using the OSTN15 transformation method. All individual LIDAR surveys going into the production of the composite had a vertical accuracy of +/-10cm RMSE. Please refer to the survey index files which shows for any location what national LIDAR programme survey went into the production of the LIDAR composite for any specific location. ESRI Image REST services are available for elevation, hillshade, slope and aspect and a tinted shaded relief image is also available as a WMS feed.

The project uses a machine learning approach to image classification, developed under the Defra Living Maps project (SD1705  Kilcoyneet al.,2017). The method first clusters homogeneous areas of habitat into segments, then assigns each segment to a defined list of habitat classes using Random Forest (a machine learning algorithm). The habitat probability map displays modelled likely broad habitat classifications, trained on field surveys and earth observation data from 2021 as well as historic data layers. This map is an output from Phase IV of the Living England project, with future work in Phase V (2022-23) intending to standardise the methodology and Phase VI (2023-24) to implement the agreed standardised methods. The Living England habitat probability map will provide high-accuracy, spatially consistent data for a range of Defra policy delivery needs (e.g. 25YEP indicators and Environment Bill target reporting Natural capital accounting, Nature Strategy, ELM) as well as external users. As a probability map, it allows the extrapolation of data to areas that we do not have data. These data will also support better local and national decision making, policy development and evaluation, especially in areas where other forms of evidence are unavailable.

Grid coordinates are on the Universal Transverse Mercator Projection, Central Meridian 0. Study Area: In June 2007, Fugro Survey Limited (FSLTD) were subcontracted by Fugro Rovtech Limited to performed environmental survey in the Gannet field, in the Central North Sea, UKCS blocks 21/25, 21/30, 22/21 and 22/26a. The field consists of a cluster of seven oil and gas fields (namely Gannet A, B, C, D, E, F and G). The survey was performed in order to investigate the effects of existing development in the area and to establish a baseline for future development. Bathymetry: Tidally uncorrected single beam echosounder spot depths recorded at sampling locations during the current study ranged from 93 m to 100 m, indicating an essentially flat seabed within the survey area. Seabed Features: Full seabed features information was not available for the survey area. However, a previous geophysical survey for a pipeline route from Bittern to Gannet A in the centre of the Gannet field (Fugro Geoteam Limited report number M2032.11, Shell Expro report number P97-146 / 31) found surficial sediments along the route to comprise fine to coarse, occasionally clayey and / or silty sand. Environmental Survey Strategy: A total of 38 stations were sampled using a 0.1 m2 Day grab with one or three physicochemical replicates retained for analysis and three macrofaunal replicates obtained at 21 of the 38 stations. Seabed photography was undertaken at the required locations for groundtruthing purposes. Granulometry: The sediments were similar across the survey area ranging from poorly to very poorly sorted, fine to very fine sand, with the exception of station D4, which was classified as very poorly sorted medium silt. Mean phi ranged from 2.52 to 3.69 (station C9 and C4, respectively), while station D4 showed a mean phi of 5.27. The sorting coefficient ranged from 1.03 (stations D6 and Ref2) to 2.19 (station D4). In general variation in the particle size composition of sediments within the survey area appeared to relate to the proximity to the historic well locations. Drill cuttings were observed in many of the samples located adjacent to the historic well locations i.e. A3, A4, C4 and D2 to D5. Comparison of granulometry data with 1990 survey data showed that levels of fines appeared to have increased across the entire survey, although this is probably due to a change in methodology (the current survey utilised wet sieving techniques followed by laser diffraction). However, it was considered significant that the areas adjacent to the historic well locations showed a disproportionate increase in fines, presumed to be due to the presence of drill cuttings, which were not present in the 1990 baseline survey. Organic Carbon: TOM for the majority of sediments from the survey area ranged from 1.2% to 2.9% (stations A10 and C2, respectively). Substantially higher levels of loss on ignition were recorded for stations adjacent to historic well locations i.e. D4 and C4, at 4.6% including station A3 at 4.0%. Several other stations showed elevated levels of TOM, between approximately 2.3% and 2.9%, reflecting their proximity to areas of drilling activity (stations A1, C5, D2, D3, D5, C2, C7 and C8)."}

As rivers integrate recharge from a large catchment, river levels can rise at a faster rate than groundwater levels, such that they become the dominant source of recharge to the shallow aquifers. Groundwater levels rise in response to recharge from rivers, tending towards an equilibrium with river levels.2) Recharge leading to high groundwater levels in bedrock aquifers:Reduced evapotranspiration during winter leads to increased groundwater recharge, raising the water table in permeable bedrock aquifers such that it reaches its annual peak in winter or spring.For full report see R65252.07R1_Guidance_Vn1 pdf.", "lineage": "Groundwater levels in superficial deposits are estimated by assuming that they are in hydraulic continuity with water levels in rivers. The topographic dataset used is the July 2016 release of the Ordnance Survey (OS) Terrain 50 digital terrain model (DTM), which is available on a 50m grid and has a vertical precision of 0.1m. This DTM was used to derive a national groundwater level map for a typical winter. River channels were derived from the DTM by assuming a threshold catchment size of 0.5 km2 for the initiation of channel formation. This catchment size is assumed to be suitable for representing river networks in areas of low permeability bedrock.Groundwater levels were estimated by using 2-D interpolation between river bank elevations and coastline elevations. The coastline was defined based on the high water line included in the OS Boundary Line dataset (January 2016 release). For areas underlain by permeable bedrock formations, the corrected BGS dataset on average high bedrock groundwater levels was used. For areas underlain by low transmissivity bedrock, and for which BGS data on bedrock groundwater levels was not available, our modelled groundwater surface based on estimated river levels and coastline elevations was used. In this way, a national dataset of average high winter-time groundwater levels was derived.Unsaturated zone thickness was derived as the difference between groundwater elevation and ground elevation from the Terrain 50 DTM.For full report see R65252.07R1_Guidance_Vn1 pdf."}

The `Y'-shaped loch system, comprising Lochs a' Chairn Bhain, Glencoul, Glendhu, Beag and Shark, is 15 km long and reaches maximum depths of 111 m in the deepest of its six basins. The relatively complex series of basins and sills categorize the system as a type `C' (Milne 1972), and result in the absence of the seasonal fjordic loch stagnation of deep water shown by other fjordic lochs. The system is steep-sided, with a relatively small littoral area, bedrock and boulders extending through the littoral and into the circalittoral in almost all areas. Sediment predominates in the middle of the loch. The sediment composition depends heavily upon the level of exposure to water movement with coarse, clean sediments in Eddrachillis Bay grading to fine soft muds in the deep water basins and at the loch heads. The sequence of sediments is interupted in the narrows region at Kylesku and on the sills, where increased current speed results in the presence of coarser sediments. The area in which the loch lies is fairly remote, with little habitation and no shore-based industry. Major uses of the loch are scampi fishing, by trawl and creel, and fish farming. The number of leased fish farm sites is currently at least 12, not all of which were occupied by fish farms at the time of the survey. Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest border on Loch Cairnbawn, one at the head of Loch Glencoul, and the other along most of the southern shore of Loch a'Chairn Bhain. Very few marine biological studies have been carried out in the loch, these being limited to some littoral recording and some grab sampling of sublittoral sediments. The present survey, carried out in October 1988, aimed to describe the marine habitats and communities present in the loch and to assess their nature conservation importance. A total of 40 sites were visited, of which 4 were littoral and 36 were sublittoral. At each site the abundance of the epiflora and fauna was recorded and the habitats described. No infaunal sampling was carried out. Thirty two sublittoral and three littoral habitat types were identified, and these are described in this report. A list of the taxa recorded is also given. The communities present in Eddrachillis Bay were open coast in nature, and there was a transition to sheltered sea loch communities further into the system. The narrows area in the middle of the loch an exception to the gradual transition, with the presence of a range of high energy habitats due to the accelerated tidal streams in this region, and was one of the more interesting features of the system. The scientific interest and conservation importance of the area have been assessed using standard criteria. These have been applied to each of the habitats or community types identified which have been provisionally graded as of Local, Regional, National or International importance. Species of particular scientific and conservation interest have been provisionally graded as of provisional Regional or National importance. Loch Cairnbawn appears to contain a good range of the habitats and community types typical of sheltered, fjordic sea lochs, with no particularly unique features. The full conservation significance of communities in the loch will only be adequately assessed when surveys of other Scottish lochs are complete. Records currently considered sensitive have been removed from this dataset.", "lineage": "This survey was extracted from a Marine Recorder snapshot."}

Attributes The structure of the schema has been changed since the 2011 woodland map release, to maintain compatibility with the new NFI update and reporting tool. Category: Woodland (W) The woodland polygons represent the extent of mapped woodland >= 0.5 ha; Non woodland (NW) The 'non-woodland' polygons represent open areas completely surrounded by woodland also >= 0.5 ha; Descriptions of Interpreted Forest Types (IFTs) Conifer (C) Coniferous woodland often occurs as large plantations with trees in regular rows and the stand edges may be regular and sharply defined. Some broadleaved trees may also be present but greater than 80% of the area will consist of conifers. Broadleaved (B) The canopy of broadleaved woodland is generally more uneven than that of coniferous woodland being made up of rounded crowns but with variations according to species, age, height, and season. Boundaries with adjacent internal polygons are generally less clearly defined than with conifers and naturally occurring stands may grade into adjacent ones with no sharp division. Some coniferous trees may be present but greater than 80% of the area will consist of broadleaved trees. Mixed (Mc) Predominantly conifer The interpretation of Mixed woodland can be very difficult as it exhibits intermediate characteristics between Conifer and Broadleaved woodland. There can be several types of mixed woodland. A plantation of alternate rows of conifer and broadleaves may produce a 'striped' appearance. You may see conifer and broadleaves planted in blocks, and there may be general intersperse woodland. The proportion of the Conifer will be more than 50% of the area and less than 80%. Mixed (Mb) Predominantly broadleaved The interpretation of Mixed woodland can be very difficult as it exhibits intermediate characteristics between Conifer and Broadleaved woodland. There can be several types of mixed woodland. A plantation of alternate rows of conifer and broadleaves may produce a 'striped' appearance. You may see conifer and broadleaves planted in blocks, and there may be general intersperse woodland. The proportion of the Broadleaves will be more than 50% of the area and less than 80%. Coppice (O) The most important characteristic of coppice areas on aerial photographs is its very even, smooth appearance. The coppice area may be made up of a patchwork of different ages (heights) but all show this very even character. Areas recently cut may appear to have a very clear floor with little felling debris. Coppice-with-Standards (P) Some areas of coppice also include larger broadleaved trees set in the coppice matrix. These broadleaved trees, often oak, are known as standards and show very clearly over the even coppice as large rounded crowns. The distribution of the standards may also be fairly scattered with approximately 25 per ha. Shrub Land (S) This category is intended to include areas that may possibly be woodland, where the growth is close to the ground and shows a rough character but no clear differentiation between Conifer and Broadleaved can yet be made. Areas being colonised by woody species may fall into this category. The cover will be at least 20%. Young Trees (N) Areas where planting is clearly visible but the trees cannot yet be allocated between Conifer and Broadleaved due to their immaturity. These areas can be on either land new to woodland or where a felled crop has been replaced. Felled Woodland (F) Areas of woodland where the trees have been harvested or felled. Stumps or felled trees may be visible and there may be long heaps of felling debris ('windrows'). Some standing trees within this limit may also be present but should be disregarded. This category should not be confused with Coppice. The areas concerned may also have been re-stocked but the new trees are not yet visible. Ground Prepared for New Planting (G) Land in this category is area recently converted from some other land use to woodland and will show plough furrows or mounding but the new planting (if present) cannot yet be discerned Cloud or Shadow Areas (CS) If cloud or shadow areas obscure woodland detail and it is difficult to allocate one of the above IFTs, then digitise a new boundary line feature around the area of uncertain forest type. Uncertain Areas (X) Where the interpreter is uncertain of the IFT/IOA to be used X will be designated. The rate of use of this category should decline over time as operators become more proficient and better at recognising IFT/IOAs. As part of the QA procedures X's will be checked and operators found using this code frequently will be subject to more intensive QA procedures and possibly more training. Low density (Ld) This category intended to include areas that have less than 20% canopy cover that might have potential to achieve woodland in the future. These areas will be monitored in future updates and either updated to reflect forest type or removed from the dataset. Assumed woodland (Aw) The supplied grant scheme and FC new planting polygons have been attributed as 'assumed woodland' as these areas have not been checked against the latest images and will be monitored in future updates and either updated to reflect forest type or removed from the dataset. Descriptions of Interpreted Open Areas (IOAs) Open water (W) Normally labelled within OSMM, areas of even colour Grass (Gs) A predominantly grassy area - may be agricultural or not. Agricultural land (Ag) May contain a cereal crop or pasture. Urban/Building (U) Buildings within woodland areas, may include gardens surrounding the building Forest road, track (Ro) Linear feature, often fairly straight with gentle bends or turning circles. River (Ri) Linear feature, depending on location can be fairly straight or meander through woodland. Powerline (L) Possible shadow evidence of poles, pylons or even the cable/lines. Quarry (Q) Show change in vegetation to geology, sand, slate, rock etc. Active quarries could have buildings, heavy plant tracks leading into the quarry. Bare (Ba) Bare ground/rock Windfarm (Wf) Possible shadow evidence of turbines, normally in groups Other vegetation (V) Not covered by the above, e.g. Gorse, Rhododendron, Bracken, Heather etc. Notes: Species such as Gorse and Rhododendron are not regarded as woodland and have therefore been excluded. Orchards are not regarded as woodland but have been mapped for carbon accounting purposes. Details can be provided on request. Interpreted Forest Types are only used to classify polygons in the NFI digital woodland map. IFTs are useful when using the map without the sample data, and for smaller geographic areas where the sample data would be inappropriate. However, for larger geographic areas data on forest types collected in the field is considered to be more accurate, and hence is used for reporting purposes"}

Licensed under Open Government Licence. Openness rating: ????? Responsible Party: Environment Agency (pointOfContact) EnvironmentThe Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic know as the OSPAR Convention 1998 (Oslo Convention 1972 & Paris Convention 1974), is an agreement signed by a number of European countries (including the United Kingdom) to protect the quality of the North East Atlantic. The objective of the OSPAR Convention is to take all possible steps to prevent and eliminate pollution entering the sea. The OSPAR Convention provides standard methods for estimating the inputs of selected pollutants to the sea by using fixed sampling schedule and a standard input calculation. All principal rivers are sampled monthly (12 times a year) just upstream of their tidal limits. For those rivers carrying the heaviest contaminant loads the sampling frequency maybe increased beyond the minimum of 12. Major trade effluents and sewage effluents to estuaries or coastal waters are also sampled monthly to assess direct discharges to marine waters. Flow values of discharges direct to estuary or sea are sometimes provided by the operators themselves. This is usually part of statutory monitoring arrangements. The aim of these programmes is to assess the level of contamination entering the sea from England and Wales (the load) and to chart the progress in the reduction of this load. The substances controlled under OSPAR are: Mercury, Cadmium, Copper, Zinc, Lead, PCB, gamma-HCH, Orthophosphate, Phosphorous (total), Nitrate, Nitrogen (total) and suspended particulate material. The load of contamination to the sea is measured at over 300 sites around the coast of England and Wales. These sites have been grouped into thirty two coastal zones. OSPAR data is updated annually approximately 6 months through the year for the previous year. Data held ranges from 1998 to the present. Its high/low based on twelve annual samples. This product provides a pair of annual estimates for each sampling point, known as high load, and low load. The difference between the high and low load estimates is owing to the way in which the samples with results at the 'limit of detection' are treated. The limit of detection is the lowest concentration of a substance that can be reliably measured  any real concentration lower than this level, including zero, is reported as being present at less than the limit of detection concentration. Where the substance has been analysed for but the concentration is below the limit of detection, a calculation can be made assuming that it is not present at all (a low load estimate). Alternatively, a calculation can be made by assuming that the substance is present exactly at the limit of detection (a high load estimate). The low load calculation gives an optimistic estimate of the real load, whereas the high load calculation gives a pessimistic estimate. The real load discharged will be somewhere between these two figures. ", "lineage": ""}

This allowed an image of the undisturbed seabed surface to be obtained for each grab sample. Samples were collected from within a 100 m radius centred on the target location. On recovery, the grab was emptied into a large plastic bin and a representative sub-sample of sediment (approx. 0.5 litres) taken for Particle Size Analysis (PSA). The sample was stored in a labelled plastic container and frozen ready for transfer to a laboratory ashore. The remaining sample was photographed and the volume of sediment measured and recorded. Benthic fauna were collected by washing the sample with sea water over a 1 mm sieve. The retained &gt;1 mm fraction was transferred to a labelled container and preserved in 4% buffered formaldehyde for later analysis ashore. A visual assessment was made of the sediment type sampled by the grab and noted on the field records, assigning the sample to a Folk class and its equivalent EUNIS and Broadscale Habitat (BSH) sediment classes."}

It has then been subject to an external peer review process by EverozePartners Limited (technical resource area) and RPS Energy (constraints analysis).The analysis follows several steps, each of which focusses on progressively smaller, less constrained andtechnically attractive areas of seabed. The list below summarises each stage:\u0122 Technical resource model: this is the starting point of the analysis and defines the area of seabedthat is most favourable for offshore wind development within the scope defined in section 2.1. Thismodel is mainly driven by water depth, wave climate and geology (note that the favourableresource area is only driven by water depth and wave climate).\u0122 Exclusions model: this forms part of the constraints analysis and removes activities and receptorsthat will preclude development such as existing infrastructure and rights, and areas where healthand safety or policy reasons mean development is unfeasible. These activities and receptors (inputcriteria) in this model are termed hard constraints.\u0122 Restrictions model: this model includes all other criteria which are structured and weighted in termsof the constraint each presents to development. The input criteria in this model are termed softconstraints.\u0122 Characterisation areas: these are defined from the result of combining the first three stages in thelist. Detailed consideration and analysis has subsequently been performed on these areas. Theaspects that are introduced in this stage of work are termed review layers."}

The area was mapped using a combination of echo soundings and observations by divers. An area of earlier dumping activity was also included in the survey. The habitats and communities inside the area and on the surrounding sea bed were described and documented by diving biologists in September 1985, and results compared with those obtained during a survey carried out prior to the latest dumping programme. The main effect of the dredge spoil was to smother all life over approximately 23,000 m/2 of the sea bed. Outside this area of blanket cover there was increased siltation on the sea bed for at least 200 m to the north. Older clay from previous dumping operations was little different in appearance from the new clay and had only been colonised by a few species giving rise to a community very different from that of the natural sea bed. Sites well to the south around the Marine Hotel did not appear to be affected. The sea bed under the recent and earlier spoil dredgings, amounting in total to around 10% of the available habitat of mixed sediments, stones and shells is thus thought to be irreversibly changed by these operations and it is recommended that no further dumping of this type of spoil should be undertaken within the estuary.

This species is widespread in Europe, but has declined since the 1940s. In the UK, GCN are widespread and locally common, with a patchy distribution, especially in South West England, parts of Wales, and in Scotland. A requirement of the Habitats Directive of each EU member state is to ensure that European Protected Species are maintained at or restored to favourable conservation status across their natural range. In order to better understand the conservation status of the species in England, a much better understanding is needed of the distribution and extent of the population of the species in its natural range, and the habitat available to it. This project forms part of a series of projects to produce an enhanced evidence base which can be used to inform decisions about land-use planning and determining conservation status. It is the first of a two-stage exercise to collect data to develop a model for predicting the presence of GCN.

Site Check of the sediment flats involved checking the presence and sequence of biotopes along the five transects surveyed in 2003. This involved recording data at the 16 relocatable stations along each transect. The sediment type and depth of the anaerobic layer was recorded and the habitat photographed using stills and video cameras. Biota was assessed by digging over areas of sediment and recording abundance recorded on the SACFOR scale. A subsidiary aim of the survey work was to produce a biotope map of the sediment flats. This involved supplementing the Site Check data by walking over the area recording the nature of the substratum and conspicuous biota observed.", "lineage": "Data collection for the Site Check survey took place at a series of relocatable stations along transects, surveyed in 2003, that reflected the biological and environmental diversity of the intertidal sediment flats in the SAC. The 5 transects (MA to ME), which included a total of 16 sample stations, were laid out perpendicular to the shore and to low water channels at the seaward end. Each station lay within a perceived habitat zone identified from the physical appearance and biological surface features. The positions of both stations and zone boundaries were recorded. At each station, a record of any surfical biota was made by photographing five replicate randomly placed 0.25 m2 quadrats and noting incidental visual records. In addition, approximately 1 m2 of sediment was dug-over using a spade, to a depth of about 30 cm to check for the presence of conspicuous infauna and estimates of their density made using the SACFOR scale. Smaller infauna was similarly recorded but sampled by sieving, using a 1 mm mesh, an area of sediment of c. 250 cm2. All transects and stations had their positions fixed by hand-held differential GPS using WGS84 datum.  For biotope mapping of the sediment flats a wireframe map (of putative habitat polygons) with aerial imagery was available in the field on a series of laminated sheets. It was also uploaded to a large-screen, sunlight-readable, differential GPS receiver (Garmin Montana 600). One team of 2 - 3 recorders surveyed the area, largely within three hours either side of low water springs by walking each of the polygons where possible, employing target notes at fixed locations to record the characteristics of the habitat. Where appropriate, descriptions of habitats between target point positions were also recorded, with the surveyors' track continuously recorded by a GPS data logger. Field data collected to aid subsequent biotope identification included physical habitat characteristics, biotic surface features and the infauna revealed by digging over an area of c. 1 m2, with retention of specimens where necessary for laboratory identification. In many cases it was also felt necessary to supplement dig-over material by sieving sediment from an area of c. 250 cm2 using a 1 mm mesh. Field observations were supplemented by still and video photography. The wireframe laminates were used for sketching the distribution of perceived habitats in the field and to aid investigation of conspicuous features on the aerial imagery. In general, biotope ascription to areas was deferred until the results of infaunal analysis were available and, in view of the limited information available at individual target sites, biotopes were assigned to areas, rather than individual sites. The biotope mapping GIS project employed the OSGB 1936 coordinate system and British National Grid projection."}

The primary objective of the project was to obtain data on the differences between the currently permitted and proposed new trawl configurations, principally to move from the widespread use of 80mm mesh cod end to a default of 100mm. This information will help to provide evidence on the performance of more selective trawl configurations to inform on proposed changes to technical measures regulations in the southwest otter trawl mixed fishery.For this purpose, two trials lasting 6 days each took place in ICES Division 7e on the twin-rig otter trawler Rockfisher (SU6) in the months of October to December 2020. The vessel conducted simultaneous comparative tows of the control gear and two experimental gears. The first trial compared two trawls, both with 100mm cod ends, and one with an 80mm square mesh panel (SMP) and the other with 100mm SMP. A total of 19 paired hauls were collected for this trial. The second trial compared 100mm cod end with an 80mm SMP to an 80mm cod end with an 80mm SMP (as normally used by the vessel). A total of 14 paired hauls were completed for the second trial.At each station sampled, shot and haul, positional, times, depths and towing speed information were recorded, and for all species of fish length distribution data were taken, including collecting data on the benthic component of the catch.", "lineage": "A fixed routine for handling and sorting the catch was maintained throughout the trials. Catches from the two cod ends were always kept separate and were processed as either the retained or discarded fraction. Cefas observers sampled using standard techniques. For each haul, all fish species caught were measured to the nearest cm below. Sub sampling was necessary on occasions when the fish catch was large, and raising factors were calculated accordingly. Additionally, benthos was separated from the discarded fish, identified down to group level, and counted. The results were compiled in Excel and plotted graphically in R."}

The first two are connected by the East Kyle of Bute, a shallow channel running between Bute and the mainland. Loch Long is the largest fjordic loch in the group; Loch Striven has some similarities to Loch Long and is the second largest. Loch Goil forms a north-west trending branch of Loch Long, separated from the main body of the loch by a shallow sill. The latter three lochs all have a small percentage of intertidal to total area. The Gareloch is relatively shallow without subtidal rocky features, but does have a sill towards the mouth. The main feature of Loch Riddon is the Ruel Estuary, which has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The entrance into the East Kyle from Loch Riddon is via the shallower tide-swept narrows around the Burnt Islands; the area experiences the strongest current surveyed in the north Clyde sealochs. The Holyloch has no sill/basin features, the seabed sloping gradually out to deeper water in the Firth of Clyde. Like the Gareloch, it has a paucity of sublittoral bedrock. The whole area has been affected by sewage pollution with some improvement over the last 25 years, but the effects are still noticeable in the Gareloch and Holyloch. There is a strong Naval presence throughout the lochs with large submarine bases in the Holyloch and Gareloch. Twenty-one littoral and 82 sublittoral sites were surveyed, from which 27 habitat or community types were described. A list of the taxa recorded is also given. All the lochs in this system were characterized by sheltered communities. Only a few shores had communities typical of moderately exposed conditions, dominated by barnacles, the majority being fucoid-dominated and giving way to Laminaria saccharina forests in the infralittoral. Algal diversity in the infralittoral was low throughout the lochs, grazing echinoderms and chitons leaving large areas of denuded rock with abundant encrusting coralline algae. Steeply sloping bedrock in the circalittoral supporting a Protanthea simplex/Neocrania anomala community with Sabella pavonina and Ciona intestinalis. On most sites, however, bedrock and boulder slopes finished around the limit of the lower infralittoral/upper circalittoral and were replaced by shelly and sandy mixed sediment slopes with mud, finally leading onto mud plains in the deeper areas of the lochs. Scavenging mobile species, including hermit crabs, gobies and dragonets plus sediment-burrowing anemones Cerianthus lloydii, slender seapens Virgularia mirabilis, burrowing and tube-forming polychaetes and burrowing bivalve molluscs were found on these mixed sediments. Deeper mud, well worked by crustaceans including the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus and the echiuran Maxmuelleria lankesteri was found in most of the lochs, other areas having beds of burrowing brittlestars, Amphiura spp. The large cerianthid anemone Pachycerianthus multiplicatus was also found in muddy sediments. Tidal streams affected sediment grading in the East Kyle. Here coarser and sandier sediments supported beds of brittlestars Ophiothrix fragilis and Ophiocomina nigra and the infauna included the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum and the burrowing holothurian Labidoplax digitata. Two rare species were found in Loch Goil; the holothurian Ocnus planci and the tunicate Styela gelatinosa. The latter is a new British record and therefore assessed as of international conservation importance. In total 6 community types and 13 species have been assessed to be of regional, national or international conservation importance.

The coastline south of Whitehaven to the Isle of Walney is generally linear except for the indentations of the Ravenglass and Duddon estuaries. The Isle of Walney is a barrier island which protects the sheltered waters of the Walney Channel to the east. The extensive sand flats of Morecambe Bay are cut by the Lune Deep which stretches south-westwards from the entrance of the Wyre Channel. Only isolated areas of hard substrata are present in the sublittoral. The most extensive area is the Lune Deep, a glacially formed kettle hole with steep boulder and cobble sides. Smaller areas of rock are present at St Bees Head, where there is outcropping bedrock. More characteristic of the region are the glacial boulder scars found littorally and sublittorally along the open coast and in the Walney Channel. Eighteen sublittoral sites were surveyed on the hard substrata. Seven hard substrata communities were identified from four seperate survey areas: St Bees Head with its exposed sand scoured communities; the rich flora and fauna of an exposed boulder scar at Selker Rocks; the sheltered tide swept scar at Head Scar in the Walney Channel, and the dense hydroid and bryozoan turf in the Lune Deep.

Where repeat surveys have been undertaken the newest, best resolution data is used. The composite is updated on an annual basis to include the latest surveys. The DTM (Digital Terrain Model) is produced from the last return LIDAR signal. We remove surface objects from the Digital Surface Model (DSM), using bespoke algorithms and manual editing of the data, to produce a terrain model of just the surface. Available to download as ASCII files in 5km grids, data is presented in metres, referenced to Ordinance Survey Newlyn, using the OSTN15 transformation. All LIDAR data has a vertical accuracy of +/-15cm RMSE. A tinted shaded relief, which is an image showing what LIDAR looks like when loaded into specialist software, is also available as a WMS feed. You can also download survey index files which shows, for any location, what Time Stamped survey went into the production of the LIDAR composite. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is an airborne mapping technique, which uses a laser to measure the distance between the aircraft and the ground. Up to 500,000 measurements per second are made of the ground, allowing highly detailed terrain models to be generated at spatial resolutions of between 25cm and 2 metres. The Environment Agencys open data LIDAR archives includes the Point Cloud data, and derived raster surface models of survey specific areas and composites of the best data available in any location.

It is designed to provide an accurate and consistent assessment of the state of water quality and how it changes over time as a national picture.  These assessments are made for Biological, Chemical and Nutrients and undertaken for discrete river stretches.The Chemistry GQAHI scheme has over 3000 sampling sites which provide information for approximately 22500 km of watercourses. In Wales we maintained the full GQA network based on 800 sampling sites which provides information for approximately 4700km.  Chemistry GQAHI/GQA sites are sampled twelve times a year, the samples being taken at the same spot on each sampling occasion to ensure consistency.  In England each chemical sample is measured for ammonia and dissolved oxygen. In Wales each chemical sample is measured for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia and dissolved oxygen (the most common types of organic pollution from sewage treatment works, agriculture and industry).  A category is assigned using three years worth of samples for each sampled chemical and assigned a category assessed against chemical standards expressed as percentiles The data collected over three years are used to determine average nutrient concentrations. So the classification for the year 2008 includes the results for 2006 and 2007.  Subsequently a category is assigned to each length of river according to the lowest standard achieved by any of the two or three measurements:The Chemistry GQA as used in Wales describes quality in terms of three chemical measurements that detect the most common types of organic pollution from sewage treatment works, agriculture and industry.

These fall broadly into those within a perceptible visual influence from land and those areas which are offshore where the influence is derived from below sea level processes which may in turn present themselves as surface sea use activities. Where areas associate with perceptible land influences, these are typically given land defined area names. Refer to Figures 1.13 and 2.12 for the extent and naming of character areas identified as an outcome of this assessment.  Boundaries are open ended and approximate in position. As such the limits of character areas at unbounded extents are not defined within the scope of the study and will need to be validated by further survey work within adjacent Marine Plan Areas.  Following consideration of the detail within the various topic headings, the baseline context was interpreted into the individual character areas to define their key characteristics, physical influences, cultural influences and aesthetic and perceptual qualities. The characterisation does not go so far as to identify forces for change or objectives as the focus is on providing an understanding of baseline context rather than to make judgement on the significance of the resource.  With the relative scale of this characterisation process, The Humber Estuary and The Wash have been delineated as individual character areas due to their generally enclosed nature, their closer visual association with the surrounding landscape and their identifiable estuarine characteristics. Smaller estuarine environments such as The Exe estuary have been excluded from the physical extent of the seascape character area boundary as their scale would be more identifiable with the land based character areas at the current scale level of assessment."}

See Emmett et al. 2010 for further details of sampling (http://www.countrysidesurvey.org.uk/outputs/technical-reports) and Griffiths et al. 2011 for further details of methods. Estimates of mean values within selected habitats and parent material characteristics across GB were made using Countryside Survey (CS) data from 2007 using a mixed model approach. The estimated means of habitat/parent material combinations using 2007 data are modelled on dominant habitat and parent material characteristics derived from the Land Cover Map 2007 and Parent Material Model 2009, respectively. The parent material characteristic used was that which minimised AIC in each model (see Dataset Documentation). Please see Scott, 2008 for further details of similar statistical analysis (http://www.countrysidesurvey.org.uk/outputs/technical-reports). Areas, such as urban and littoral rock, are not sampled by CS and therefore have no associated data. Also, in some circumstances sample sizes for particular habitat / parent material combinations were insufficient to estimate mean values.

This inventory replaces Natural England's separate woodland BAP inventories (lowland mixed deciduous woodland, wet woodland, lowland beech and yew woodland, upland mixed ash woodland and upland oakwood). These earlier inventories were derived from Ancient Woodland Inventory polygons, attributed using SSSI and Phase II survey data and ecological modelling of habitats. The inventory provides England-wide coverage of semi-natural habitats and provides more comprehensive coverage than the previous separate inventories. An inclusive policy has been adopted, assuming that woodlands classed as one of the above categories (i.e. non-plantation) fall with one of the Habitat Action Plan woodland categories. The data is derived from the National Forest Inventory (NFI). It includes the following categories:Broadleaved (B) - The canopy of broadleaved woodland is generally more uneven than that of coniferous woodland being made up of rounded crowns but with variations according to species, age, height, and season. Boundaries with adjacent internal polygons are generally less clearly defined than with conifers and naturally occurring stands may grade into adjacent ones with no sharp division. Some coniferous trees may be present but greater than 80% of the area will consist of broadleaved trees.Mixed (Mb) - Predominantly broadleaved. The interpretation of Mixed woodland can be very difficult as it exhibits intermediate characteristics between Conifer and Broadleaved woodland. There can be several types of mixed woodland. A plantation of alternate rows of conifer and broadleaves may produce a 'striped' appearance. You may see conifer and broadleaves planted in blocks, and there may be general intersperse woodland. The proportion of the Broadleaves will be more than 50% of the area and less than 80%.Coppice (O) - The most important characteristic of coppice areas on aerial photographs is its very even, smooth appearance. The coppice area may be made up of a patchwork of different ages (heights) but all show this very even character. Areas recently cut may appear to have a very clear floor with little felling debris.Coppice-with-Standards (P) - Some areas of coppice also include larger broadleaved trees set in the coppice matrix. These broadleaved trees, often oak, are known as standards and show very clearly over the even coppice as large rounded crowns. The distribution of the standards may also be fairly scattered with approximately 25 per ha.The National Forest Inventory was interpreted based on: Ordnance Survey MasterMap (OSMM), features have been used as a reference for capturing the woodland boundaries. The woodland boundaries were interpreted from colour aerial orthophotographic Imagery. The photographic images aimed to be no older than 3 years at the time of creating the digital map. A minimum area of 0.5 hectares under stands of trees with, or with the potential to achieve, tree crown cover of more than 20% of the ground. Areas of young trees, which have the potential to achieve a canopy cover of more than 20%, will also be interpreted as woodland and mapped. All woodland (both urban and rural, regardless of ownership) which is 0.5ha or greater in extent has been mapped Woodland, those which are less than 0.5ha in extent will not be described within this dataset.Miscellaneous adjustments to original aerial photography interpretation (API) have been made as detected by Survey Foresters, Woodland Grant Schemes (1992 to 2002) and additional aerial photography interpretation update for part of North England (flown 1999-2000).In total 214848 polygons were captured, covering approximately 808,858.89Ha.

This provided an indicative layer for the area of peat and peat soils in England. Soils classed as deep peaty soils were selected for use in this project. Moorland line classification was used to select upland areas from within this mapped area of deep peaty soils. The moorland line is mapped to represent areas of unimproved, moorland vegetation representations to remove areas of non-moorland land from the moorland line. As such, it represents our best mapping of upland moorland in England, and should contain no areas of non-moorland vegetation larger than 5ha in size. This provides a map of deep peaty soils under moorland vegetation. In addition, all areas under 1ha were deleted from the data set. The aim of this was to remove all areas which were smaller than the minimum mappable unit for this exercise and to reduce the total number of polygons to be assessed, while maintaining the greatest possible assessment area.

The `Y'-shaped loch system, comprising Lochs a' Chairn Bhain, Glencoul, Glendhu, Beag and Shark, is 15 km long and reaches maximum depths of 111 m in the deepest of its six basins. The relatively complex series of basins and sills categorize the system as a type `C' (Milne 1972), and result in the absence of the seasonal fjordic loch stagnation of deep water shown by other fjordic lochs. The system is steep-sided, with a relatively small littoral area, bedrock and boulders extending through the littoral and into the circalittoral in almost all areas. Sediment predominates in the middle of the loch. The sediment composition depends heavily upon the level of exposure to water movement with coarse, clean sediments in Eddrachillis Bay grading to fine soft muds in the deep water basins and at the loch heads. The sequence of sediments is interupted in the narrows region at Kylesku and on the sills, where increased current speed results in the presence of coarser sediments. The area in which the loch lies is fairly remote, with little habitation and no shore-based industry. Major uses of the loch are scampi fishing, by trawl and creel, and fish farming. The number of leased fish farm sites is currently at least 12, not all of which were occupied by fish farms at the time of the survey. Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest border on Loch Cairnbawn, one at the head of Loch Glencoul, and the other along most of the southern shore of Loch a'Chairn Bhain. Very few marine biological studies have been carried out in the loch, these being limited to some littoral recording and some grab sampling of sublittoral sediments. The present survey, carried out in October 1988, aimed to describe the marine habitats and communities present in the loch and to assess their nature conservation importance. A total of 40 sites were visited, of which 4 were littoral and 36 were sublittoral. At each site the abundance of the epiflora and fauna was recorded and the habitats described. No infaunal sampling was carried out. Thirty two sublittoral and three littoral habitat types were identified, and these are described in this report. A list of the taxa recorded is also given. The communities present in Eddrachillis Bay were open coast in nature, and there was a transition to sheltered sea loch communities further into the system. The narrows area in the middle of the loch an exception to the gradual transition, with the presence of a range of high energy habitats due to the accelerated tidal streams in this region, and was one of the more interesting features of the system. The scientific interest and conservation importance of the area have been assessed using standard criteria. These have been applied to each of the habitats or community types identified which have been provisionally graded as of Local, Regional, National or International importance. Species of particular scientific and conservation interest have been provisionally graded as of provisional Regional or National importance. Loch Cairnbawn appears to contain a good range of the habitats and community types typical of sheltered, fjordic sea lochs, with no particularly unique features. The full conservation significance of communities in the loch will only be adequately assessed when surveys of other Scottish lochs are complete. Records currently considered sensitive have been removed from this dataset.", "lineage": "This survey was extracted from a Marine Recorder snapshot."}

The scale of the data is 1:50 000 scale. Onshore coverage is provided for all of England, Wales, Scotland and the Isle of Man. Data are supplied as five themes: bedrock, superficial deposits, mass movement, artificial ground and linear features. Bedrock geology describes the main mass of solid rocks forming the earth's crust. Bedrock is present everywhere, whether exposed at surface in outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits or water bodies. Geological names are based on the lithostratigraphic or lithodemic hierarchy. The lithostratigraphic scheme arranges rock bodies into units based on rock-type and geological time of formation. Where rock-types do not fit into the lithostratigraphic scheme, for example intrusive, deformed rocks subjected to heat and pressure resulting in new or changed rock types; then their classification is based on their rock-type or lithological composition. This assesses visible features such as texture, structure, mineralogy. Superficial deposits are younger geological deposits formed during the most recent geological time; the Quaternary. These deposits rest on older rocks or deposits referred to as bedrock. The superficial deposits theme defines landscape areas (shown as polygons) attributed with a geological name and their deposit-type or lithological composition. Mass movement describes areas where deposits have moved down slope under gravity to form landslips. These landslips can affect bedrock, superficial or artificial ground. Mass movement deposits are described in the BGS Rock Classification Scheme Volume 4. However this data also includes foundered strata, where ground has collapsed due to subsidence (this is not described in the Rock Classification Scheme). Caution should be exercised with this data; historically BGS has not always recorded mass movement events and due to the dynamic nature of occurrence significant changes may have occurred since the data was released. Artificial (man-made) theme (shown as polygons) indicates areas where the ground surface has been significantly modified by human activity. Whilst artificial ground may not be considered as part of the 'real geology' of bedrock and superficial deposits it does affect them. Artificial ground impacts on the near surface ground conditions which are important to human activities and economic development. Due to the constantly changing nature of land use and re-use/redevelopment, caution must be exercised when using this data as it represents a snapshot in time rather than an evolving picture hence the data may become dated very rapidly. Linear features (shown as polylines) represent geological structural features e.g. faults, folds or landforms e.g. buried channels, glacial drainage channels at the ground or bedrock surface (beneath superficial deposits). Linear features are associated most closely with the bedrock theme either as an intrinsic part of it for example marine bands or affecting it in the case of faults. Landform elements are associated with both bedrock and superficial deposits.", "lineage": "Generalised digital geological map data based on BGS's New Series 1:50 000 and 1:63 360 scale (one-inch to one-mile) maps with updated nomenclature.

She arrived in Loch Broom around midday on 4 June where an acoustic calibration was performed prior to beginning transecting. Clupea steamed to the start of the Summer Isles area transects, inside Isle Martin, on the morning of 5 June to begin acoustic transecting and pelagic trawling. Transecting and trawling continued all day in the open water area. The following day, 6 June, transecting and trawling was carried out in Little Loch Broom, and then Clupea returned to the open water area and continued transecting for the rest of the day. On 7 and 8 June, transecting and trawling in the open water of the Summer Isles area then continued. A naval exercise in the area prevented a trawl from being carried out on marks in the outer area surveyed. Clupea moved down the Loch Hourn on the morning of 9 June and worked there for the day. She then headed up to Kyle for the night to take on water and receive some supplies from Aberdeen. Transecting continued in Loch Hourn in the morning of 10 June, then Clupea moved round to Loch Nevis to begin work there. Work continued in Loch Nevis in the morning of 11 June until around 1030. Clupea then steamed down to Mull to begin work in that area. Work began in Loch Tuath around 1400 and continued for the rest of the day there. On the morning of 12 June the last piece of work in Loch Tuath was completed and transecting began in the open water to the west of Mull. The open water transects continued until the entrance to Loch na Keal was reached in mid-afternoon. Transecting began there at around 1600 and continued to the end of the working day. Work in Loch na Keal continued on the morning of 13 June. The decision was made to then work in Loch Scridain as the weather was considered to be too poor to continue the Mull open water transects and the forecast for the following day was fair. Transecting and trawling was then carried out in Loch Scridain for the rest of that day and work was completed by 1000 on 14 June. Clupea then moved back to the Mull open water transects and completed work there by 1600. Breakdown of the sonar meant that two of the transects going through shallow areas had to be shortened, by a distance of around 3 miles. Clupea then steamed for an overnight stop in Mallaig, to take on water. On the morning of 15 June she steamed for Loch Kishorn, where work commenced, until around 1600 when the surveying was cut short, two and a half transects away from the head of the loch. A buoy had been snagged and in the attempt to untangle the rope from the pole carrying the acoustic equipment the pole got badly bent, rendering further acoustic surveying impossible. Work finished in the loch around 1900 and Clupea steamed for Fraserburgh where she arrived at 1830 on 16 June 2005. Staff disembarked there at 1000 on 17 June, after unloading and debrief, and returned to Aberdeen by minibus.The light gauge recorded data throughout the cruise to determine ambient light levels. The mini-logger was deployed on the headline during each trawl, along with the Scanmar sensors. In each area and loch a CTD was carried out at the centre point of each tow. A number of CTD dips were then carried out through each loch to determine vertical structure throughout.In the Summer Isles area (including Little Loch Broom) four pelagic tows and nine CTD deployments were carried out; in Loch Hourn there were two pelagic tows and five CTD deployments; in Loch Kishorn, one pelagic tow and five CTD deployments; in Loch Nevis, zero pelagic tows and five CTD deployments and in the Mull area three pelagic tows and 16 CTD deployments were carried out. The time and position data for these tows and CTDs are in Tables 1 and 3 respectively. All areas were characterised by a lack of fish and an abundance of jellyfish, both coelenterates (primarily Aurelia aurita and Cyanea capillata) and ctenophores (most likely Pleurobrachia pileus). In 7 of the 10 hauls, jellyfish comprised more than 98% of the catch (Table 2). In only 1 haul (off the west coast of Mull) were fish the dominant component of the catch (85%). Many of the fish were young-of-the-year and have been retained for identification."}

A Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) is a large-scale assessment of the risks associated with coastal processes and helps reduce these risks to people and the developed, historic and natural environments. Coastal processes include tidal patterns, wave height, wave direction and the movement of beach and seabed materials. The SMPs provide a route map for local authorities and other decision makers to move from the present situation towards meeting our future needs, and will identify the most sustainable approaches to managing the risks to the coast in the short term (0-20 years), medium term (20-50 years) and long term (50-100 years).

The estuary is approximately 10km in length and between 1 and 2 km in width at the high water mark. Most of this area dries at low water leaving a channel of less than 500m at its widest point. The estuary is sheltered from prevailing winds and wave action to a large extent by Dawlish Warren, an unusual double spit which has been formed across the mouth of the estuary. This feature, together with an area of shoaling sand called Pole Sand, restricts the sea opening of the estuary to a long narrow channel. Currents are rapid as a consequence of river and tidal flow being restricted to a narrow channel for much of the tidal cycle. In addition, salinity is reduced over most of the estuary, particularly at low water after significant rainfall. On these occasions, the water at Topsham may almost be fresh. Benthic habitats are sedimentary in nature with extensive mud and sand flats intertidally. Patches of saltmarsh and swards of Zostera spp. occur in the muddier reaches. There are no rocky shores within the estuary and what little alternative hard substrata there is consist of stones and small boulders concentrated around the high water mark. Stone-faced railway embankments down either side of the estuary occasionally fall within the upper intertidal zone. Subtidally, habitats are also predominantly sedimentary, ranging from sand, stones and boulders at the mouth to mud at the head. Outcrops of flat bedrock occur in the narrow channel entrance. Outside the main estuary basin, rocky shores occur east of Exmouth at Maer Rocks, and at Orcombe point and beyond. There is little commercial fishing within the estuary, apart from netting for salmon, trout and eels. Shellfish, mainly oysters but also including some mussels and manilla clams, are also grown-on at sites within the estuary. The area is used intensively for recreation, including most watersports, and the sandy beaches on the open coast are popular with tourist. In addition many visitors are attracted specifically by the overwintering populations of waders and wildfowl for which the Exe is of international importance. The area has long been of scientific interest, both biologically and physiographically, and is currently used for both educational and research purposes.The geological, ornithological and marine biological importance of the estuary is well recognised and is detailed in the notification of both Dawlish Warren, and the rest of the estuary, as SSSI,s. In addition, Dawlish Warren is a Local Nature Reserve and the western half of the estuary from Dawlish Warren up to Turf has been designated a wild bird sanctuary. The present survey, carried out in August 1985, aimed to collect information on the variety of intertidal and subtidal habitats and communities present. The last descriptive marine biological survey covering the whole estuary took place in 1901. In order to determine what changes, if any, had taken place since that time, many of the old sample sites were re-visited. A total of 47 sites were sampled, of which 34 were intertidal and 13 were subtidal. At each intertidal site the abundance of epiflora, epifauna and conspicuous infaunal species was recorded in situ. Sediment cores were taken and sieved over a 0.1mm mesh to obtain samples of the macrofauna. Subtidal areas were sampled using a combination of trawling, pipe-dredging and diving. During the survey, a total of five intertidal and four subtidal habitats were distinguished. Epifaunal and algal diversity was generally low due to the scarcity of stable hard substrata. However the infauna was richer and was typically estuarine in nature with dense populations of species such as Nereis diversicolor, Scrobicularia plana and Lanice conchilega to be found locally. Diversity tended to be higher in the heterogenous muddy sand areas of the middle and lower reaches of the estuary. Further north, sediments were of uniform mud and were influenced by reduced or fluctuating salinities. Around the estuary mouth, faunal populations in the tidally swept clean sands were often comparitively sparse, but notable for including the polychaete Ophelia bicornis which has attracted much scientific study since the 1940's. The main characteristics of the communities found do not appear to have changed significantly since the turn of the century. However, in contrast to previous records, neither Nucella lapilus or Sabellaria alveolata were found during the present survey. The former species appears to have declined dramatically in southwest Britain recently, and organotin compounds in antifouling paint are suspected as a possible cause. The latter species has been shown to fluctuate widely in abundance at any one site, and it is possible that trampling pressure plays a part in such variation. Alien species are also present including Sargassum muticum on rocky shores just outside the main estuary. The scientific interest and nature conservation importance of the area has been assessed using standard criteria and the conservation importance of the habitat and communities in the area have been provisionally graded as of Local, Regional, National and International importance. Species of particular scientific interest identified during survey work have also been noted and their conservation importance provisionally graded as of Regional, National or International importance. The Exe estuary is considered to be of high scientific interest for its populations of Ophelia bicornis and because it supports infaunal communities that are representative of their type in southwest Britain. This is in addition to the well recognised importance of the area for estuarine birds. Furthermore, such scientific study has been, and still is, carried out here alongside its continuing use for educational purposes. Potential threats to these interest are all associated with the recreational usage of the estuary which is already high. These include the proposals to build marina facilities, the effects of organotin antifouling compounds and bait digging.

Both datasets are statutory Instruments and together they provide different classifications of land in England based on the difficulty of farming. Less Favoured Areas are a transposed European Commission designation which provides special measures to assist farming in the areas designated. The Less Favoured Areas consist of Severely Disadvantaged and Disadvantaged Areas. They are (mainly upland) areas where the natural characteristics (geology, altitude, climate, etc.) make economic competition difficult. In place since 1975, it is a long standing measure of the Common Agricultural Policy. The Moorland Line is a further designation of land within the LFA, and it is also used under domestic legislation to better target support for the uplands.

The purpose of SPZs is to provide additional protection to safeguard drinking water quality through constraining the proximity of an activity that may impact upon a drinking water abstraction. This is part of an initial screening process in assessing impacts to groundwater resources. Zones around location sites are defined by groundwater travel time to an abstraction. This is determined through applying Environment Agency groundwater flow models run at the location of abstractions inputting parameters such as flow direction geology type rainfall and hydrological boundaries. SPZs provide a visual representation of the increased risks as you get closer to the abstraction. The following subdivisions are defined within SPZs: - Zone 1: (Inner Protection Zone) - This zone is defined by a travel time of 50-days or less from any point within the zone at or below the water table. Additionally the zone has as a minimum a 50-metre radius. It is based principally on biological decay criteria and is designed to protect against the transmission of toxic chemicals and water-borne disease. - Zone 2: (Outer Protection Zone) - This zone is defined by the 400-day travel time from a point below the water table. Additionally this zone has a minimum radius of 250 or 500 metres depending on the size of the abstraction. The travel time is derived from consideration of the minimum time required to provide delay dilution and attenuation of slowly degrading pollutants. - Zone 3: (Total catchment) - This zone is defined as the total area needed to support the abstraction or discharge from the protected groundwater source.

BSM was conducted in two phases: 1) an acoustic survey; 2) a ground-truthing survey through camera deployments (video and still photography). The aim of the acoustic element of the survey was to identify different backscatter returns and describe, as well as delineate, the extent of the various seabed habitat types occurring around North Rona. A digital sidescan sonar mosaic, in conjunction with single beam echo sounder derived bathymetry, provided the initial broadview to map the substrata present throughout the survey area as well as allowing the identification of any features of interest. The aim of the ground-truthing element of the survey was to provide a description of the richness and diversity of the habitats on both rocky reef and the softer sediments. The biotope distribution and species composition was developed through interpretation of dropdown video footage and digital still photography, taken after evaluation of the sidescan mosaic.

The objectives of the acoustic survey were to acquire bathymetric data using a dual frequency single beam echo sounder and high frequency sidescan sonar. The objectives of the ground-truthing survey were to acquire high resolution video and still photographs using a drop-down camera system and an ROV. Acoustic survey work was undertaken between 26th June and 2nd July 2009, onboard Seastar Survey Ltd's survey vessel RV Otarie. Ground-truthing survey work was undertaken later in the summer between 3rd and 13th August 2009 by the same contractors and survey vessel.  1) Acoustic survey work: acoustic field work was undertaken using a Leica 1200 RTK Rover GPS system, an EdgeTech FS 4200 dual frequency sidescan sonar system, and a Marimatech E-Sea Sound 206 dual frequency echosounder (33/200 kHz). The acoustic survey area was divided into three main areas (E, S, W) with 16, 20, and 13 planned acoustic lines in each, respectively, to simplify survey operations and ensure that the acoustic work was completed in its entirety within the SAC. Seabed backscatter data was collected using an EdgeTech 4200-FS dual frequency (120/410 kHz) sidescan sonar. Processing of the bathymetric data was undertaken using the post processing tools within the survey management software. This was undertaken with reference to the echo sounder paper trace records as part of our quality control procedures. 2) Ground-truthing survey work: fieldwork was undertaken using a Kongsberg OE 14-208 shallow water camera system mounted obliquely on a seabed camera frame. A flash unit and two sub-sea lights were also mounted on the frame. These units were linked to the surface with a soft umbilical cable. The shallow-water camera system was used for the ground-truthing of the sidescan sonar imagery. All camera deployments were established as transects across sites of interest, which were selected after scrutinising the acoustic survey data. The vessel was positioned at one end of a transect using DGPS. The camera was then deployed and lowered to the seabed. Once the camera system was at the seabed and had time to settle, the vessel drifted along the transect at approximately 0.5 knots. The camera frame was towed immediately above the seabed during the deployments, resulting in a seabed coverage of each still photograph of approximately 1 m2. Before each deployment a ???clapper board??? containing site name, date and weather conditions was videoed and photographed as a quality assurance (QA) record."}

ICP Forests was mandated to monitor air pollution effects on forests and to contribute to a better understanding of cause-effect relationships.  Within the complex of anthropogenic and natural stresses, air pollution continues to be regards as an important stress factor. Air pollution and its effects on forest ecosystems are complex and difficult to isolate and quantify. A large number of other stress factors also have an influence on forest condition and must therefore be taken into consideration. The objective of the Level II network was therefore: to contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between the condition of the forest ecosystems and anthropogenic factors (in particular air pollution) as well as natural stress factors through intensive monitoring on a number of selected permanent observation plots spread over Europe and to study the development of important forest ecosystems in Europe.  Data collection in the Level II/(Later FutMon) was modular in nature, in that it each assessment type was independent of the others. Included here are the daily meteorological data.", "lineage": "Protocols followed as listed in the ICP Forests Manual. The UK established 24 plots as part of the Level II programme - most of these were not running at the same time however. The network expanded and contracted following funding issues. The plot site selection criterion was that the plots should be located in such a way that the most important forest species and the most widespread growing conditions should be represented. Each plot had a minimum size of 0.25 Ha with a 10m buffer zone around it.   The technical details of the sampling of each assessment are outlined in the ICP Forests Manual already referenced.

It opens to the south-west and its mouth is partially protected by the small MacCormaig Isles. The main body of the loch is relatively straight, with a fringe of rocks or gravel giving way to a sandy or muddy seabed. There are a number of arms to the loch which add considerably to the diversity of habitats present. Linne Mhuirich forms an arm to the west, with a constricted mouth into Loch Sween forming an area of tidal rapids. At the head of the loch, arms include the silled Caol Scotnish. Adjacent to Loch Sween, once connected to it but now separated by causeway, is Loch na Cille. Loch Sween has been proposed as a Marine Nature Reserve by NCC on account of the high scientific interest and conservation importance of the habitats and communities within the loch. Although a site of historical marine biological recording and research, NCC commissioned extensive systematic littoral and sublittoral surveys in 1982. Further information was required on the distribution and types of littoral habitats and communities present to assess the relative importances of individual areas and the integrated importance of the whole loch. The aims of the shore surveys in 1985 were; to investigate the shores around Ceann an t-Sailein; to assess any temporal variation in faunal communities, particularly molluscan, in the Linne Mhuirich area; and to describe the shores of Loch na Cille. Survey work was carried out during spring and autumn visits. Descriptions of all the sites are included in the report, which also contains a detailed species list and tables showing the numbers of Mollusca associated with algae. The discussion is limited to a summary of the more important information found during the spring surveys. The report concludes that Ceann an t-Sailein adds another habitat type (a shallow tidal bay with a clay floor) to those already known in Loch Sween. Several community types were recorded from the sediment shores. Further variability in molluscan populations was noted but showed no clear pattern which could be related to seasonality. Several mollusc species new to Loch Sween were recorded.

It links ArcView 8 GIS and ORACLE (a relational database management system, or RDMS). Spatial information (polygons covering acquisitions and disposals of land areas, FC accesses, FC servitudes, legal boundaries) and deeds database information (attributes) are all managed within ArcView 8.      The use of ArcSDE software sitting on a server in each territorial MGIU location further enhances the system by storing both the spatial data and the deeds attribute data in the same Oracle file, which also allows multi-user access to the data.  The use of SDE also means backup arrangements are easier, since both the spatial and attribute data are backed up at the same time.       Maintenance Functions in the Deed Management Extension:   1.

It was created to support prioritisation of first round applications to the Slurry Infrastructure Grant, which Defra launched in October 2022. It identifies designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in England which have known features sensitive to ammonia emissions and that currently exceed the threshold at which adverse effects are known to occur, called their critical level. These sites were then buffered by 2 km to identify priority areas for air quality improvements. * The technical document sets out the methods proposed for and selected to identify the sites most vulnerable to ammonia emissions in England to prioritise the Slurry Infrastructure Grant\u2019s first round applications.The method used was developed in consultation with an expert group made up of Air Quality specialists across Defra and its associated Arms-Length Bodies. The spatial layer contains embedded features from a number of datasets, however the original features have been heavily altered and none of the original attributes have been retained. Full details on how this layer was used, alongside a water quality layer, to prioritise applications to the grant can be found at: [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/slurry-infrastructure-grant](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/slurry-infrastructure-grant).These resources may not be fully accessible for all users.

The geometric lineage is derived from Natural England's 2021 SSSI Condition Units dataset.

These datasets were intersected to identify sites where the ammonia concentration exceeded the critical level. These sites were then buffered by 2km. It is expected that the dataset will be updated for the second round of the grant, due to be launched in Autumn 2023. The method used to develop this dataset has been externally peer-reviewed, full details can be found in the associated methods document."}

MV Domoch and the MV Titan Explorer were used to conduct the survey work between 27th September and 26th November 2004. The survey area encompassed the turbine box and two potential cable routes. Principle aims were to provide detailed information on the bathymetry, seabed morphology, potential obstructions and shallow geology in the survey areas. Echosounder data, sidescan sonar data, magnetometer and sub bottom profiler (boomer) data were acquired from survey main lines across the turbine box spaced at 100m, cross lines at 1000 metres and additional peripheral lines around the outside of the box spaced at 125m. Post Processed Kinematic (PPK) GPS was used for tidal reduction of all bathymetric data. Data was recorded via a Trimble 4400 GPS receiver linked to a Trimble TSCI data collector. A Trimble AG132 GPS receiver was utilised as the primary navigation system. Seabed mapping was achieved using an Edgetech DF1000 duel frequency digital sidescan sonar. The data were recorded on an EPC model GSP - 1086 grey scale printer as merged data. Sub-bottom data were collected using an Applied Acoustics tow boomer system. The transmitter array comprises a capacitor bank, tow cable and catamaran containing the boomer plate. Magnetometer data were collected using a Geometrics GS881 Caesium Magnetometer. The Octopus 360 sub bottom processor was used to acquire high resolution digital data. The Octopus 760 system acts as a side scan receiver capable of interfacing with any two channel or four channel sidescan sonar system. The system operates in real time and allows the acquisition of high resolution digital data in .XTF format. Bathymetric data were collected using an Odom Hydrotrac echosounder.", "lineage": " "}

Surveys were carried out on two days. On October 10th 1982, 11 sites were surveyed in the region of Gateholm. On October 24th 1982, 3 sites were surveyed to the east of Martins Haven. Survey staff included biologists and divers recruited from the Pembrokeshire BS-AC Branch 417. Broad descriptions of habitats and communities were made based on the recording card developed for the South-West Britain Sublittoral Survey. Areas to the west and south of Gateholm were found to be predominantly rocky with some areas of sand. Rich plant and animal communities were observed, but it was not considered that any especially unusual communities or species were present. The sea bed to the north of Gateholm included extensive areas of sand but where rock was present, species characteristic of open-coast conditions were more common than to the south. Areas to the east of Martins Haven were remarkably similar in the habitats and communities present. Here, the bedrock and boulder slope with fringing areas of small boulders, stones and shells, extended only about 30 m from the shore and to depths of about 14 m. Offshore, there was plain of muddy sand charaterised by a fairly epifaunal community. Some alterations to the habitats mapped by P. Hunnam in 1976 were made and it was also found difficult to match descriptions from the present work to the small number of categories included on the 1976 map. It was concluded that the absence of any sublittoral habitats or communities of outstanding interest south of Gateholm would allow the termination of the reserve boundary at the western point of Gateholm and that, to include the areas of offshore rocky sea bed, there could usefully be a straight-line boundary from Gateholm Point to 500 m south of the Mew Stone. On the northern coast, it was suggested that, providing the boundary extended at least as far east as High Point, there were no biological grounds for precisely determining its eastern extent beyond that. The presence of very extensive areas of muddy sand with similar communities from about 40 m offshore provoked questioning of the offshore extent of the reserve boundary which could be as little as 200 m to include the main communities of conservation interest. However, practical points of navigation and enforcement would be important considerations and no recommendations have been made. It was also pointed out that a straight-line boundary from 500 m north of the Garland Stone towards the east would be practical.

The results of monitoring during the second year of wind farm operation (September 2008 to April 2009) are presented here.Surveys were undertaken from a vessel which followed seven established set transects through the wind farm, buffer (edge of the wind farm) and reference areas. Two experienced ornithologists noted all bird species seen and also made observations on any marine mammals encountered.Analysis efforts are focused on four target species: common scoter, red-throated diver, cormorant and common tern. These species are important to local conservation sites such as the proposed Liverpool Bay SPA, Dee Estuary SPA and the Mersey Narrows and North Wirral Foreshore SSSI/candidate SPA.Previous reports have presented results of baseline and during construction ornithological surveys (2005/06 and 2006/07 respectively). This is the second set of post construction surveys. Five surveys were completed in 2008/2009, reflecting an agreement with statutory consultees to focus effort in months of interest (September to April). Subject to no significant adverse effects being identified there is an agreement to conclude the ornithological monitoring programme at this stage.Low numbers of birds were recorded in the survey, which continues to demonstrate that the area is not intensively used by seabirds. However, this years survey did provide the first evidence of birds (auks) present within the wind farm array area, assumed to be foraging.

{"title": "Species point records from 1982 Jones Menai Strait littoral rock survey", "altTitle": "", "source": "JNCC", "custodian": "", "topics": "oceans", "keywords": "Marine,Marine Recorder,JNCCMNCR10000129,MNCR,Species", "abstract": "This survey was undertaken as part of a general study of the Menai Strait, commisioned by NCC, required to assist in decisions related to its designation as one of Britain's Marine Nature Reserves. Parallel surveys of the soft substrata and sublittoral hard substrata have also been conducted. The work was carried out during the summer of 1982 and subsequently supplemented by visits to less fully recorded sites. The purpose of this survey is to provide a topographical and biological description of the Anglesey and Arfon sides of the Menai Strait, concentrating on the hard or stable substrata and the animals and plants which live in these habitats. Flora and fauna lists are appended which cover all substrata. They are derived mainly from records in UCNW, Bangor, including those at the Marine Science Laborities, the School of Animal Biology and the School of Plant Biology. Additional records are from published material or personal information. Hard substrata have been studied rather longer than the soft, and littoral recording has been going on for longer than sublittoral work, but it has been highly selective; some areas of the Strait have been the subject of collecting and recording for many years; others have seldom been visited. This implies a judgement on the relative richness and interest and, in general, this difference in relative richness and interest is borne out by the observations of the present survey which may be summarised as follows: 1) The Menai Strait is an area of very unusual shores of great ecological interest. 2) This is because of a wide variety of rock types and other substrata and especially because these are subjected to strong tidal currents which are most rapid where wave action is minimal. This interest is not uniform, however, and some parts of the area stand out as particularly exciting: 1) Church Island and the adjacent shores, 2) Black Rock, 3) Puffin Island and Penmon, 4) Ynys y Moch and adjacent shores, 5) Gorad y Gyt to the Britainnia Bridge, 6) Llanddwyn, 7) Dinas Dinlle. Black Rock and Ynys y Moch are included in this list because of their past glories rather than their present depressed state. These shores make a particularly strong case for a policy of protection to prevent further damage by bait-digging. In the case of Ynys y Moch, some active restoration measures are also practicable but the recovery of shores like Black Rock will require a long period of peace. Llanddwyn and Dinas Dinlle are not high on the list because, though both include species not found elsewhere in the Strait, neither is particular rich by comparison with boulder or rocky shores farther along the north Wales coast. However, all these shores are of great interest and worthy of special efforts to conserve and protect. There are also stretches of the Strait where the littoral interest is not great. These must include the shores from Beaumaris to Ynys Gaint; Plas Newydd to Tal y Foel; Britainnia Bridge to Caenarvon. Further investigation is merited into possible reasons for absence or variations in flora and fauna on different sides of man-made structures in some isolated localities. There is no doubt that the Church Island region and whole of the Swillies shores between the bridges would merit NNR status in any assessment of British coasts. The inclusion of other parts of the Menai Strait must depend partly on the philosophy behind marine reserves. Thus the limits of Puffin Island to Llanddwyn/Dinas Dinlle define a clear geographical area and include, in the last two shores, typical (though not the richest) examples of certain habitats. The NE end of the Strait, however, is intrinsically more interesting than the SW and the Puffin Island, Black Rocks, Cae Coch and Penmon shores are worthy of inclusion on their own merits. This implies three possible limits: 1) The central reach, for which an overwhelming case exists, 2) The central and NE reaches, from Puffin Island to the Brittainnia Bridge, for which a strong case can be made on ecological grounds, 3) The whole of the Strait, for which the case tends to be more a matter of geographical unity. The historical aspect of conservation must also be considered. There are two main issues related to different time scales. In the longer scale, there are a series of structures used since the middle ages in a method of fishing, peculiar to the Menai Strait and surviving in various states of dilapidation. A major gap in our knowledge appears from this survey relating to these man-made structures and the activities of fishermen and other users of the waters in previous years. In the last 10 - 20 years, there has been an irreplaceable loss of local knowledge by the death of so many elderly people who had earned their living from the Straits. It is now probably too late to save more than a fraction of this once widespread knowledge, but an effort should certainly be made before the last remnants disappear. These Goradau should be made the subject of special conservation measures; one or more could be restored and used experimentally to establish the methods and efficiency of the fishery. Fundamental biological information would almost certainly be acquired at the same time. The most obvious Gorad on which to begin would be Gorad Bach near Beaumaris Life Boat House, which was the most recently used trap and where knowledge of the methods still survives. On a shorter time scale, extensive recording of animals and plants was carried out in the years 1887 - 1891 on Puffin Island, in other parts of the region in the next few years. This gives a picture of these shores at a point in time since when changes have occurred. We are approaching a hundred years since that surge of activity and another intensive recording period would produce very interesting comparisons and might be a very appropriate start to the management plan of a new reserve. In this connection it might be added that there are areas of potential interest which have never been adequately explored. These include Ynys Gorad Goch, the Brittainnia Rock, the Platters and Swilly rock; it is ironic that these are within the central area which possesses, in Church Island, the most intensively studied shores of all. In fact, the establishment of a Marine Nature Reserve in the Menai Strait is not merely an attempt to preserve a very well known stretch of coast - it can be a stimulus to more active investigation of a surprisingly incompletely explored area. Records currently considered sensitive have been removed from this dataset.", "lineage": "This survey was extracted from a Marine Recorder snapshot."}

At present, thirty outfalls discharge crude sewage into the lower River Bure, causing some organic enrichment to the lower River Bure. The survey was carried out in the first week in June 1987.

It was also postulated that much of the mercury discharged through the Norwich sewage works during the previous twenty years has accumulated in the sediments of Breydon Water. The estuary was found to support a healthy, but undiverse invertebrate fauna. The lack of diversity was thought to be due to the homogeneity of the sediment types and the lack of extremes of salinity within Breydon Water.

The weather was exceptionally poor and delayed the start of work such that funding had to be carried forward into the next financial year. Fieldwork commenced in May at a site off Southport, but despite the experimental gear deploying and working as envisaged, no razor clams were caught.It was decided that a new fishing area should be tried and at the suggestion of the skipper, a diving company was engaged to survey positions where catches had been made previously. One position was found to have a significant density of razor clams and this was chosen as a target for the next trip.

Natural England have a duty to assess the condition of the SACs features once every six years and have therefore established (in association with other countryside agencies), a series of common standards for the monitoring of sites of nature conservation interest.  These common standards apply to a number of statutory designated sites, including SACs, and are used in conjunction with other relevant guidance to ensure that a consistent approach is taken when monitoring these sites.the Inner Solway Firth SAC, the intertidal sandy mud communities which are a sub-feature of the mudflats and sandflats not covered by seawater at low tide qualifying habitat (Natural England &amp; Scottish Natural Heritage, 2010), fall under the Common Standards Monitoring (CSM) guidance produced for littoral sediment habitats (Joint Nature Conservation Committee, 2004).  For the purposes of monitoring, each feature of the SAC has an associated series of attributes which are measurable indicators of the condition of the feature at the site.  A target is set for each attribute which is considered to correspond to the favourable condition of the feature.Regulation 33 (2)(a) of The Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 (as amended), Natural England (NE) and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) have a duty to advise other relevant authorities as to the conservation objectives for the European Marine Site.  For the marine qualifying interests of the Solway Firth SAC (of which sandy mud communities are a sub-feature of the mudflats and sandflats not covered by seawater at low tidethe conservation objectives provided by NE and SNH (2010) are as follows: Subject to natural change, avoid deterioration of the qualifying habitat (Estuaries, Sandbanks which are slightly covered by seawater all the time, Mudflats and sandflats not covered by seawater at low tide, Reefs, Salicornia and other annuals colonising mud and sand, and Atlantic salt meadows (Glauco-Puccinellietalia maritimae)) thus ensuring that the integrity of the site is maintained and the site makes an appropriate contribution to achieving favourable conservation status for each of the qualifying interests.ensure for the qualifying habitats that the following are maintained in the long term:  d{Extent of the habitat on site.of the habitat within site.and function of the habitatsupporting the habitat.of typical species of the habitat.of typical species as components of the habitat.significant disturbance of typical species of the habitat.  dSurvey Aims and Objectives  dThe Inner Solway is designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), and the current study therefore forms part of a long term monitoring programme being jointly administered by Natural England (NE), and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) under the requirements of the Habitats Directive (and enabling UK legislation).  An intertidal biotope survey was undertaken by IECS on behalf of Natural England (then English Nature) in 2004, with the survey covering both the north and south banks of the Solway (Hemingway et al., 2006).  In 2011, the inner Solway together with the middle to outer south shore were again surveyed for biotope composition and extent (Cutts et al., 2011).current survey programme of intertidal biotope mapping work on the south shore of the Solway (survey effort and platform prescribed in the project specification) covered a similar area to that of the previous 2011 survey.  The ecological survey work was designed to monitor and assess the mudflats and sandflats not covered by seawater at low tide (intertidal mudflats and sandflats) of the Solway Firth SAC, and the survey objectives as defined under the project specification were therefore to report the following information:  d{Extent of the infaunal communities as estimated from line transects.characteristics (grain size, organic content, and depth of redox layer) along transects, and relationship to observed changes in biological community.biotope detail and spatial extent.and contrast changes in extent and type of biological communities and sediment character within previous studies from the same area (biotope status and change).  dMethodology  dSurvey  dThis involved the in situ field surveying and mapping of the soft sediment habitats of the intertidal zone of the study area in accordance with the agreed survey schedule using a hovercraft survey platform.  The survey transects (track files) undertaken during the Phase 1 survey are shown in Maps 2-4, covering the upper inner estuary (Old Graitney to Port Carlisle), lower inner Solway (Cardurnock Flatts &amp; Moricambe), and the middle estuary/open coast from Blitterlees Bank to Dubmill Point.  As noted above, the current methodology required a two phase survey effort, with the first phase involving a general characterisation of the area.  Based on the analysis of information derived from Phase 1, samples were subsequently collected at 20 stations during Phase 2 in order to fully describe the invertebrate and sediment conditions and the associated biotopes present.  Maps 2 to 4 show both the Phase 1 transects (with potential biotopes as identified on completion of Phase 1), together with the locations from which Phase 2 samples were taken for more detailed taxonomic analysis.1 sampling was undertaken between 16th to 19th June 2014 (inclusive), with Phase 2 undertaken on the 16th and 17th July 2014.  Table 2 above provides tide times (high and low water) for the nearest secondary ports to the survey locations.  Detailed In-field SamplingStandard NMBAQC and WFD protocols for sampling of benthic core samples and particle size analysis (PSA) were followed during the Phase 2 survey.  Twenty sampling stations were identified in order to provide core samples from each distinct biotope, these covering the inner to middle/outer estuary, and with the greatest sampling effort being in areas of highest biotope diversity.aim of the approach was to provide a combination of spatial coverage together with a degree of statistical robustness, allowing spatial and temporal comparisons with previous data/reports.each sampling station (located approximately in the centre of each distinct biotope or habitat), three replicate core samples (0.01 m2were taken to a depth of 15cm.  Samples were placed in pre-labelled plastic bags and transferred to labelled, clean plastic buckets at the end of each survey day.  At this point, the samples were fixed using 4% buffered formaldehyde solution.  An additional fourth core was taken for Particle Size Analysis with these samples being kept chilled until collection by the analysing laboratory.  Laboratory AnalysisInvertebrate taxonomic analysis of the replicate core samples was carried out under contract to Natural England by APEM Ltd (Edinburgh), APEM Report No. 413565-01 issued October 2014. Particle size analysis (PSA) was carried out under contract to Natural England by the National Laboratory Service (Environment Agency), NLS Report ID 20072718 - 1 issued in January 2015.    d\"\""}

Parallel surveys of the soft substrata and sublittoral hard substrata have also been conducted. The work was carried out during the summer of 1982 and subsequently supplemented by visits to less fully recorded sites. The purpose of this survey is to provide a topographical and biological description of the Anglesey and Arfon sides of the Menai Strait, concentrating on the hard or stable substrata and the animals and plants which live in these habitats. Flora and fauna lists are appended which cover all substrata. They are derived mainly from records in UCNW, Bangor, including those at the Marine Science Laborities, the School of Animal Biology and the School of Plant Biology. Additional records are from published material or personal information. Hard substrata have been studied rather longer than the soft, and littoral recording has been going on for longer than sublittoral work, but it has been highly selective; some areas of the Strait have been the subject of collecting and recording for many years; others have seldom been visited. This implies a judgement on the relative richness and interest and, in general, this difference in relative richness and interest is borne out by the observations of the present survey which may be summarised as follows: 1) The Menai Strait is an area of very unusual shores of great ecological interest. 2) This is because of a wide variety of rock types and other substrata and especially because these are subjected to strong tidal currents which are most rapid where wave action is minimal. This interest is not uniform, however, and some parts of the area stand out as particularly exciting: 1) Church Island and the adjacent shores, 2) Black Rock, 3) Puffin Island and Penmon, 4) Ynys y Moch and adjacent shores, 5) Gorad y Gyt to the Britainnia Bridge, 6) Llanddwyn, 7) Dinas Dinlle. Black Rock and Ynys y Moch are included in this list because of their past glories rather than their present depressed state. These shores make a particularly strong case for a policy of protection to prevent further damage by bait-digging. In the case of Ynys y Moch, some active restoration measures are also practicable but the recovery of shores like Black Rock will require a long period of peace. Llanddwyn and Dinas Dinlle are not high on the list because, though both include species not found elsewhere in the Strait, neither is particular rich by comparison with boulder or rocky shores farther along the north Wales coast. However, all these shores are of great interest and worthy of special efforts to conserve and protect. There are also stretches of the Strait where the littoral interest is not great. These must include the shores from Beaumaris to Ynys Gaint; Plas Newydd to Tal y Foel; Britainnia Bridge to Caenarvon. Further investigation is merited into possible reasons for absence or variations in flora and fauna on different sides of man-made structures in some isolated localities. There is no doubt that the Church Island region and whole of the Swillies shores between the bridges would merit NNR status in any assessment of British coasts. The inclusion of other parts of the Menai Strait must depend partly on the philosophy behind marine reserves. Thus the limits of Puffin Island to Llanddwyn/Dinas Dinlle define a clear geographical area and include, in the last two shores, typical (though not the richest) examples of certain habitats. The NE end of the Strait, however, is intrinsically more interesting than the SW and the Puffin Island, Black Rocks, Cae Coch and Penmon shores are worthy of inclusion on their own merits. This implies three possible limits: 1) The central reach, for which an overwhelming case exists, 2) The central and NE reaches, from Puffin Island to the Brittainnia Bridge, for which a strong case can be made on ecological grounds, 3) The whole of the Strait, for which the case tends to be more a matter of geographical unity. The historical aspect of conservation must also be considered. There are two main issues related to different time scales. In the longer scale, there are a series of structures used since the middle ages in a method of fishing, peculiar to the Menai Strait and surviving in various states of dilapidation. A major gap in our knowledge appears from this survey relating to these man-made structures and the activities of fishermen and other users of the waters in previous years. In the last 10 - 20 years, there has been an irreplaceable loss of local knowledge by the death of so many elderly people who had earned their living from the Straits. It is now probably too late to save more than a fraction of this once widespread knowledge, but an effort should certainly be made before the last remnants disappear. These Goradau should be made the subject of special conservation measures; one or more could be restored and used experimentally to establish the methods and efficiency of the fishery. Fundamental biological information would almost certainly be acquired at the same time. The most obvious Gorad on which to begin would be Gorad Bach near Beaumaris Life Boat House, which was the most recently used trap and where knowledge of the methods still survives. On a shorter time scale, extensive recording of animals and plants was carried out in the years 1887 - 1891 on Puffin Island, in other parts of the region in the next few years. This gives a picture of these shores at a point in time since when changes have occurred. We are approaching a hundred years since that surge of activity and another intensive recording period would produce very interesting comparisons and might be a very appropriate start to the management plan of a new reserve. In this connection it might be added that there are areas of potential interest which have never been adequately explored. These include Ynys Gorad Goch, the Brittainnia Rock, the Platters and Swilly rock; it is ironic that these are within the central area which possesses, in Church Island, the most intensively studied shores of all. In fact, the establishment of a Marine Nature Reserve in the Menai Strait is not merely an attempt to preserve a very well known stretch of coast - it can be a stimulus to more active investigation of a surprisingly incompletely explored area. Records currently considered sensitive have been removed from this dataset.", "lineage": "This survey was extracted from a Marine Recorder snapshot."}

The minimum requirement for data contributed to the project were that they should include associated effort data, including data for effort periods when no sightings were made and that the effort data should include records of sea state. Approximately 216,031 hours of effort are from vessel and aerial surveys and 133,999 hours of land based effort are analysed spanning a 20 year period. The project database contains 12 species. In addition the Welsh Strandings Database managed by Marine Environmental Monitoring was reviewed. As well as this grey seal data were sourced from CCW comprising of approximately 3500 individuals. A grid with resolution of 10' latitude and 10' longitude was used, and effort partitioned into segments that could be assigned to a particular grid cell. Effort and sightings formed three separate tables (vessel, aerial and land) and these were then linked to a third table holding data on position and sea area of each cell. Count rates of animals at the surface were calculated for the 5 regular species. Edition 1 of the Atlas was produced in 2009.

The purpose of the generalised modelling project was to fill the gaps where there was no detailed local modelled data in 2004, in order to define the extents of Flood Zones for spatial planning. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model called JFlow was used to produce both the modelled fluvial flood depth and modelled fluvial flood depth with climate change data.

Each site is categorised as either Ancient Semi Natural Woodland (ASNW), Restored Ancient Woodland Site (RAWS), Plantation on Ancient Woodland Site (PAWS) or Ancient Woodland Site of Unknown Category (AWSU). Initially all woods greater than 2 ha shown on the Ordnance Survey (OS) 1:25 000 1st Series maps surveyed between 1880 and 1960 were considered. Evidence as to which of these were ancient was provided by presence on the earlier 19th century OS 1st Edition Maps (surveyed 1805 - 1873; scale 1:63 360). The general presumption was that woodland on 1800s maps was ancient, unless there was other evidence that the wood originated between 1600AD and 1800. Supportive indications of ancient status included the wood's name, its situation in the landscape, and the nature of both the surrounding pattern of enclosure and the pattern of boundaries within the wood. Where available, field survey data such as the presence of indicator species, or other historical maps and documents were also used. In mountainous areas such as Wales the first edition Ordnance Survey 1 inch maps were hard to interpret because the heavy hatching used to indicate steep slopes tended to obscure tree symbols.", "lineage": "The areas of ancient woodland with non-native trees planted on them, termed Plantations on Ancient Woodland Sites (PAWS), and those areas of ancient semi-natural woodland (ASNW) were identified and delimited by using the latest Ordnance Survey maps and field survey records. The area of each was measured using a dot grid overlay on flat projections of the 1:25 000 1st series map. The results were presented as a series of reports and maps by administrative regions (counties). As new information has been received from surveys and ad hoc informants, the initial county inventories have been revised by adding or deleting sites, or by changing the classification of the growing stock. The Ancient Woodland Inventory (AWI) identifies woodlands that have had a continuous woodland cover for centuries. Studies show that these woodlands are typically of higher nature conservation value than those that have developed recently. In the 1980s the former Nature Conservancy Council instigated the AWI, which attempted to list all ancient woodlands in Britain. A baseline date of 1600 AD was adopted because reasonable maps were available from this time (in England, at least). 1600 AD however, was an arbitrary date, and there was no clear ecological cut-off. The AWI was always considered to be provisional and subject to refinement, and never a definitive listing of the ancient, or the 'best' woods. Between 2010 and 2011 Forestry Commission Wales (FCW) and Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) commissioned a revision of the AWI in Wales comparing the existing AWI and National Forest Inventory with the Epoch 1: 1st County Series Ordnance Survey maps in terms of identification of ancient woodland. Epoch 1 County Series maps provide a more reliable and comprehensive baseline than the AWI. Moreover, the Epoch 1 maps incorporate numerous practical advantages over the AWI in terms of their ease of use, accuracy and level of detail."}

The first two are connected by the East Kyle of Bute, a shallow channel running between Bute and the mainland. Loch Long is the largest fjordic loch in the group; Loch Striven has some similarities to Loch Long and is the second largest. Loch Goil forms a north-west trending branch of Loch Long, separated from the main body of the loch by a shallow sill. The latter three lochs all have a small percentage of intertidal to total area. The Gareloch is relatively shallow without subtidal rocky features, but does have a sill towards the mouth. The main feature of Loch Riddon is the Ruel Estuary, which has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The entrance into the East Kyle from Loch Riddon is via the shallower tide-swept narrows around the Burnt Islands; the area experiences the strongest current surveyed in the north Clyde sealochs. The Holyloch has no sill/basin features, the seabed sloping gradually out to deeper water in the Firth of Clyde. Like the Gareloch, it has a paucity of sublittoral bedrock. The whole area has been affected by sewage pollution with some improvement over the last 25 years, but the effects are still noticeable in the Gareloch and Holyloch. There is a strong Naval presence throughout the lochs with large submarine bases in the Holyloch and Gareloch. Twenty-one littoral and 82 sublittoral sites were surveyed, from which 27 habitat or community types were described. A list of the taxa recorded is also given. All the lochs in this system were characterized by sheltered communities. Only a few shores had communities typical of moderately exposed conditions, dominated by barnacles, the majority being fucoid-dominated and giving way to Laminaria saccharina forests in the infralittoral. Algal diversity in the infralittoral was low throughout the lochs, grazing echinoderms and chitons leaving large areas of denuded rock with abundant encrusting coralline algae. Steeply sloping bedrock in the circalittoral supporting a Protanthea simplex/Neocrania anomala community with Sabella pavonina and Ciona intestinalis. On most sites, however, bedrock and boulder slopes finished around the limit of the lower infralittoral/upper circalittoral and were replaced by shelly and sandy mixed sediment slopes with mud, finally leading onto mud plains in the deeper areas of the lochs. Scavenging mobile species, including hermit crabs, gobies and dragonets plus sediment-burrowing anemones Cerianthus lloydii, slender seapens Virgularia mirabilis, burrowing and tube-forming polychaetes and burrowing bivalve molluscs were found on these mixed sediments. Deeper mud, well worked by crustaceans including the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus and the echiuran Maxmuelleria lankesteri was found in most of the lochs, other areas having beds of burrowing brittlestars, Amphiura spp. The large cerianthid anemone Pachycerianthus multiplicatus was also found in muddy sediments. Tidal streams affected sediment grading in the East Kyle. Here coarser and sandier sediments supported beds of brittlestars Ophiothrix fragilis and Ophiocomina nigra and the infauna included the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum and the burrowing holothurian Labidoplax digitata. Two rare species were found in Loch Goil; the holothurian Ocnus planci and the tunicate Styela gelatinosa. The latter is a new British record and therefore assessed as of international conservation importance. In total 6 community types and 13 species have been assessed to be of regional, national or international conservation importance.

Since river waterbodies are attributed with a unique identifier (EA_WB_ID) this dataset can be linked directly to other WFD data sources such as physical characteristics, risk, classification and proposed objectives.

By protecting these species and habitats MCZs will contribute to a network of MPAs in the UK, together with existing MPAs (European Marine Sites, and marine elements of SSSIs and Ramsar sites) and other national designations being planned in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This means the MPA network will be a collection of areas that work together to provide more benefits than an individual area could on its own. Natural England and JNCC will provide detailed advice to Public Authorities on the sensitivity of MCZ habitats and species following designation.The sediment samples were processed by Cefas following the PSA methodology recommended by the National Marine Biological Analytical Quality Control (NMBAQC) Scheme (Mason, C. 2011. NMBAQC's Best Practice Guidance. Particle Size Analysis (PSA) for Supporting Biological Analysis. National Marine Biological AQC Coordinating Committee, 72pp, December 2011). In summary, a subsample was removed and laser diffraction completed on &lt;1mm fraction. The rest of the sample was split at 1mm and the &gt;1mm dry sieved at 0.5f intervals. The &lt;1mm was dried and weighed and used to calculate proportion of &lt;1mm:&gt;1mm. Sieve and laser data were merged to produce a complete Particle Size (PS) distribution at 0.5f intervals. The final results were quality assured, cross-checking PS results with field descriptions and grab photographs.All data has been made available under the Open Government Licence (`http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/`_).
