CTD data for 39 vertical dips. minilogger data for 10 deployments. 11 surface light level files. Objectives:1.To carry out detailed acoustic surveys in selected lochs and bays on the mainland side of the North Minch and southern Skye using the EK 500 and SEABAT to determine the distribution and abundance of juvenile herring and sprat. Concentrations of pelagic fish will be sampled using the PT154. Species composition and length-frequency distributions of the fish caught will be determined. Sub-samples will be weighed and otolithed to establish age-length and length-weight relationships. Herring samples will be analysed for sex, maturity, Ichthyophonus and Cryptocotyle lingua infection. Sprat samples will be analysed for Lernaeenicus sprattae, L. encrasicoli and Cryptocotyle lingua infection. Stomach samples will also be taken from both herring and sprat.2.For each haul from which stomachs are taken a vertical plankton net dip will be carried out.3.A series of CTDs will be carried out through each loch and bay sampled. Survey Areas:Summer Isles area/Little Loch Broom; Lochs Hourn, Kishorn, Nevis; the west of Mull including Lochs Tuath, na Keal and Scridain.","Staff joined the Clupea in Fraserburgh on 3 June 2005, from where she sailed at 1600. She arrived in Loch Broom around midday on 4 June where an acoustic calibration was performed prior to beginning transecting. Clupea steamed to the start of the Summer Isles area transects, inside Isle Martin, on the morning of 5 June to begin acoustic transecting and pelagic trawling. Transecting and trawling continued all day in the open water area. The following day, 6 June, transecting and trawling was carried out in Little Loch Broom, and then Clupea returned to the open water area and continued transecting for the rest of the day. On 7 and 8 June, transecting and trawling in the open water of the Summer Isles area then continued. A naval exercise in the area prevented a trawl from being carried out on marks in the outer area surveyed. Clupea moved down the Loch Hourn on the morning of 9 June and worked there for the day. She then headed up to Kyle for the night to take on water and receive some supplies from Aberdeen. Transecting continued in Loch Hourn in the morning of 10 June, then Clupea moved round to Loch Nevis to begin work there. Work continued in Loch Nevis in the morning of 11 June until around 1030. Clupea then steamed down to Mull to begin work in that area. Work began in Loch Tuath around 1400 and continued for the rest of the day there. On the morning of 12 June the last piece of work in Loch Tuath was completed and transecting began in the open water to the west of Mull. The open water transects continued until the entrance to Loch na Keal was reached in mid-afternoon. Transecting began there at around 1600 and continued to the end of the working day. Work in Loch na Keal continued on the morning of 13 June. The decision was made to then work in Loch Scridain as the weather was considered to be too poor to continue the Mull open water transects and the forecast for the following day was fair. Transecting and trawling was then carried out in Loch Scridain for the rest of that day and work was completed by 1000 on 14 June. Clupea then moved back to the Mull open water transects and completed work there by 1600. Breakdown of the sonar meant that two of the transects going through shallow areas had to be shortened, by a distance of around 3 miles. Clupea then steamed for an overnight stop in Mallaig, to take on water. On the morning of 15 June she steamed for Loch Kishorn, where work commenced, until around 1600 when the surveying was cut short, two and a half transects away from the head of the loch. A buoy had been snagged and in the attempt to untangle the rope from the pole carrying the acoustic equipment the pole got badly bent, rendering further acoustic surveying impossible. Work finished in the loch around 1900 and Clupea steamed for Fraserburgh where she arrived at 1830 on 16 June 2005. Staff disembarked there at 1000 on 17 June, after unloading and debrief, and returned to Aberdeen by minibus.The light gauge recorded data throughout the cruise to determine ambient light levels. The mini-logger was deployed on the headline during each trawl, along with the Scanmar sensors. In each area and loch a CTD was carried out at the centre point of each tow. A number of CTD dips were then carried out through each loch to determine vertical structure throughout.In the Summer Isles area (including Little Loch Broom) four pelagic tows and nine CTD deployments were carried out; in Loch Hourn there were two pelagic tows and five CTD deployments; in Loch Kishorn, one pelagic tow and five CTD deployments; in Loch Nevis, zero pelagic tows and five CTD deployments and in the Mull area three pelagic tows and 16 CTD deployments were carried out. The time and position data for these tows and CTDs are in Tables 1 and 3 respectively. All areas were characterised by a lack of fish and an abundance of jellyfish, both coelenterates (primarily Aurelia aurita and Cyanea capillata) and ctenophores (most likely Pleurobrachia pileus). In 7 of the 10 hauls, jellyfish comprised more than 98% of the catch (Table 2). In only 1 haul (off the west coast of Mull) were fish the dominant component of the catch (85%). Many of the fish were young-of-the-year and have been retained for identification.",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,Y,,,,,,,,Y,Y,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scale of the data is 1:50 000 scale. Onshore coverage is provided for all of England, Wales, Scotland and the Isle of Man. Data are supplied as five themes: bedrock, superficial deposits, mass movement, artificial ground and linear features. Bedrock geology describes the main mass of solid rocks forming the earth's crust. Bedrock is present everywhere, whether exposed at surface in outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits or water bodies. Geological names are based on the lithostratigraphic or lithodemic hierarchy. The lithostratigraphic scheme arranges rock bodies into units based on rock-type and geological time of formation. Where rock-types do not fit into the lithostratigraphic scheme, for example intrusive, deformed rocks subjected to heat and pressure resulting in new or changed rock types; then their classification is based on their rock-type or lithological composition. This assesses visible features such as texture, structure, mineralogy. Superficial deposits are younger geological deposits formed during the most recent geological time; the Quaternary. These deposits rest on older rocks or deposits referred to as bedrock. The superficial deposits theme defines landscape areas (shown as polygons) attributed with a geological name and their deposit-type or lithological composition. Mass movement describes areas where deposits have moved down slope under gravity to form landslips. These landslips can affect bedrock, superficial or artificial ground. Mass movement deposits are described in the BGS Rock Classification Scheme Volume 4. However this data also includes foundered strata, where ground has collapsed due to subsidence (this is not described in the Rock Classification Scheme). Caution should be exercised with this data; historically BGS has not always recorded mass movement events and due to the dynamic nature of occurrence significant changes may have occurred since the data was released. Artificial (man-made) theme (shown as polygons) indicates areas where the ground surface has been significantly modified by human activity. Whilst artificial ground may not be considered as part of the 'real geology' of bedrock and superficial deposits it does affect them. Artificial ground impacts on the near surface ground conditions which are important to human activities and economic development. Due to the constantly changing nature of land use and re-use/redevelopment, caution must be exercised when using this data as it represents a snapshot in time rather than an evolving picture hence the data may become dated very rapidly. Linear features (shown as polylines) represent geological structural features e.g. faults, folds or landforms e.g. buried channels, glacial drainage channels at the ground or bedrock surface (beneath superficial deposits). Linear features are associated most closely with the bedrock theme either as an intrinsic part of it for example marine bands or affecting it in the case of faults. Landform elements are associated with both bedrock and superficial deposits.","Generalised digital geological map data based on BGS's New Series 1:50 000 and 1:63 360 scale (one-inch to one-mile) maps with updated nomenclature.

Echointegration will be carried out at 38, 120 and 200 kHz. Data gathered in the hours of darkness will not be used for stock assessment. Trawling operations will be carried out as and when marks are identified. Otoliths will be collected from a sub-sample of the herring to determine age. The maturity state and. presence of Icthyophonus infection will also be recorded.The track will be similar to that carried out by FRV Clupea in 1991 given below (Figure 1). The survey will involve following a pre-set survey pattern, at a steaming speed of 8 knots. The intention is to spend the first three days surveying the southern part of the area, weather permitting, finishing in Campbeltown to change Fishery Officers. The rest of the time left will be spent covering the northern part of the survey, finishing in Campbeltown to allow the Fishery Officer to disembark, before setting sail to be in Fraserburgh for the morning of the 14 October",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multibeam bathymetry data processed with the Caraibes software (v3.9) and a 30m grid created.The data was acquired in 1995 when multibeam systems were first emerging onto the commercial market. The number of beams per ping was limited and thus the data density low in comparison to more modern data. Data editting was only done on data that was significantly in error. The multibeam backscatter data was also processed in the Caraibes software package and produced 2 mosaics at 50m resolution. The backscatter data did not have higher resolution data. Correlation with ground truth data, consisting of sediment samples and photographic imagery samples, predominantly toward the top of slope and seamount summit and flanks,allowed basic interpretation of the bathymetry and backscatter data near the sample locations. To aid interpetation, the sediment samples had been divided into FOLK categoriesand habitat type determinations, as well as faunal communities in some instances, had beeen made for the photographic imagery samples.Characterisation was spread over the whole area and divided into polygon regions by finding interpretive boundaries on either backscatter imagery (such as texture changes or contrast changes) or on the bathymetric layers of slope, rugosity and relief.Derived using acoustic data supplied by Ifremer (FR).Additional information source:Sotheran, I., Benson, A. &amp; Crawford-Avis, O., (2014), Mapping habitats and biotopes from acoustic datasets to strengthen the information base of Marine Protected Areas in Scottish waters â€“ Phase 2 (Barra Fan and Hebrides Terrace Seamount Area), JNCC Report 527, ISSN 0963 8901",Associated datasets: GB200045-48,Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scope was extended when bathymetric data from the 2001 survey, carried out by Fugro Ltd, was also made available for comparison. The data comparison has indicated seabed level variations over parts of the development area. When comparing the 2006 data to the 2001 data, the data showed marked lateral, west to east shift in the contours on the large southerly area of the sand waves. This shift has resulted in highly localised seabed level changes, particularly along the crests and troughs of the large sand waves, which is caused by gradual movement of these large bed forms from west to east across the area.", ,Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The report introduces Lundy, it's natural history and the NTZ. Three monitoring programmes were designed to test a number of hypotheses. These monitoring programmes looked at lobsters and crabs, scallops and sessile epifauna. Four species of commercially-fished crustaceans were monitored as part of the lobster and crab assessment. Sampling was done using standard fishing pots deployed at various locations, allowing for comparison. The locations were the NTZ, two 'near controls' and two 'far reference' locations. Abundance and size measurements (carapace length) were recorded for each species. The abundance and size of scallops along a number of transects was recorded by divers. The transects were within four sites - two within the NTZ and two within a control zone - but no far reference sites. Similarly, the assessment of sessile epifauna was conducted by divers at four sites (two within the NTZ and two controls) but no far reference sites. A list of 15 species were selected for monitoring. Quadrats were placed at pre-determined distances along a transect line and the epifaunal abundances recorded. The data from each of the monitoring programmes was statistically analysed and the results are presented within the repoort. The concluding discussion interprets the results, makes considerations for future research and includes a final summary.

Eight marine mammal species are known to occur regularly in this area: grey seal, harbour seal, harbour porpoise, white-beaked dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin, killer whale, and minke whale. Long-finned pilot whales and Risso's dolphins are regularly seen in waters around Shetland. There are occasional at-sea records of at least a further five cetacean species (humpback whale, fin whale, sperm whale, striped dolphin and short-beaked common dolphin) and four pinniped species (hooded seal, bearded seal, ringed seal and walrus).","Report prepared by the Sea Mammal Research Unit, St Andrews University as part of the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change's Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessment programme. There is extensive information on the distribution and abundance of grey and harbour seals around Britain from annual aerial surveys of breeding colonies and from satellite telemetry studies. There is also extensive information on cetacean distribution in the North Sea from a number of summer sightings surveys (SCANS-94, NASS-89, NILS-95). Estimates of abundance are available from these surveys for some species. There are also many records from year-round surveys by the European Seabirds at Sea Consortium (ESAS) since 1979, from cetacean observations made during seismic surveys from 1996, and sightings by voluntary observers compiled by the Sea Watch Foundation. Acoustic studies using towed hydrophone arrays, pop-up sonobuoys and the US Navy's passive underwater monitoring system (SOSUS) have been used to monitor the distribution and in some cases the density of fin whales, sperm whales and dolphins in the wider area (Swift et al 2002).",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MV Domoch and the MV Titan Explorer were used to conduct the survey work between 27th September and 26th November 2004. The survey area encompassed the turbine box and two potential cable routes. Principle aims were to provide detailed information on the bathymetry, seabed morphology, potential obstructions and shallow geology in the survey areas. Echosounder data, sidescan sonar data, magnetometer and sub bottom profiler (boomer) data were acquired from survey main lines across the turbine box spaced at 100m, cross lines at 1000 metres and additional peripheral lines around the outside of the box spaced at 125m. Post Processed Kinematic (PPK) GPS was used for tidal reduction of all bathymetric data. Data was recorded via a Trimble 4400 GPS receiver linked to a Trimble TSCI data collector. A Trimble AG132 GPS receiver was utilised as the primary navigation system. Seabed mapping was achieved using an Edgetech DF1000 duel frequency digital sidescan sonar. The data were recorded on an EPC model GSP - 1086 grey scale printer as merged data. Sub-bottom data were collected using an Applied Acoustics tow boomer system. The transmitter array comprises a capacitor bank, tow cable and catamaran containing the boomer plate. Magnetometer data were collected using a Geometrics GS881 Caesium Magnetometer. The Octopus 360 sub bottom processor was used to acquire high resolution digital data. The Octopus 760 system acts as a side scan receiver capable of interfacing with any two channel or four channel sidescan sonar system.

For this contract, intertidal surveys were undertaken of mudflats, sandflats and cobble skears in selected areas of Morecambe Bay, the Lune Estuary, the Wyre Estuary and the Ribble Estuary. The surveys were carried out along a series of transects positioned to encounter the widest possible ranges of biotope and also to facilitate comparison with historical data. A range of data were collected along each transect, including information on sediment character, infaunal community, saltmarsh condition and anthropogenic influences.  Recommendations for future surveys include the provision of an up-to-date set of aerial photos (at low water) in order to take into account any channel movements when positioning transects.","The survey methodology used was based on CSM guidance (JNCC, 2004) and the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) Handbook for Marine Intertidal Phase 1 Survey and Mapping (Marine Science Report No 00/06/01, Wyn et al., 2000). 42 transects were surveyed. Transects were established so as to maximise the number of biotopes identified, at locations characterised by those with high conservation value or those subject to change due to anthropogenic or natural processes. Transects were positioned to cover any areas which have previously been surveyed or monitored in order to facilitate comparison with historical data. In order to assess the infauna present at each sampling station, a 203mm diameter sieve was used, with a 500?Ç¬µm mesh. One full sieve of sediment was sampled at each station At each station three or four photographs were taken using an Olympus M? 300 Digital camera. Sediment characteristics were observed using a rapid infield assessment technique.  Positions were recorded using a handheld Garmin e-trex GPS receiver using British National Grid coordinates and OSGB 36 datum.

There is a high likelihood of surviving prehistoric archaeology (10,000 - 5000 years old) in certain areas of SEA7, most notably to the west of the Outer Hebrides for a distance of some 10km, to a depth of -20m, and in and among the islands elsewhere (particularly around Islay, Jura, Mull and the Small Isles) along the coast and between S Scotland and N Ireland.The reasons comprise a complex interplay of changing sea level and the rebound of the land once freed from the compression of ice at the end of the last Ice Age. The net result of these physical effects is that 10,000 years ago relative sea level has been up to 45m lower along much of the coast and this corresponds with the period of early human settlement in the area. In places this means that considerable areas of submerged land exist. An investigation of bathymetric, sedimentary and tidal data for the area suggests that the prehistoric land surface, including archaeological remains, may survive in many places. Cooperation between existing extraction companies and renewable industries and archaeologists elsewhere in Britain shows how the recording and investigation of archaeological material could be beneficial to both parties should work take place in SEA7. The final sections provide a preliminary examination of how matters might be taken forward to safeguard the archaeological knowledgebase without prejudicing commercial interests.","This report was prepared by C R Wickham-Jones and S Dawson (School of Geography and Geosciences, University of St Andrews) as part of the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change's Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessment programme.

Grid coordinates are on the Universal Transverse Mercator Projection, Central Meridian 0. Study Area: In June 2007, Fugro Survey Limited (FSLTD) were subcontracted by Fugro Rovtech Limited to performed environmental survey in the Gannet field, in the Central North Sea, UKCS blocks 21/25, 21/30, 22/21 and 22/26a. The field consists of a cluster of seven oil and gas fields (namely Gannet A, B, C, D, E, F and G). The survey was performed in order to investigate the effects of existing development in the area and to establish a baseline for future development. Bathymetry: Tidally uncorrected single beam echosounder spot depths recorded at sampling locations during the current study ranged from 93 m to 100 m, indicating an essentially flat seabed within the survey area. Seabed Features: Full seabed features information was not available for the survey area. However, a previous geophysical survey for a pipeline route from Bittern to Gannet A in the centre of the Gannet field (Fugro Geoteam Limited report number M2032.11, Shell Expro report number P97-146 / 31) found surficial sediments along the route to comprise fine to coarse, occasionally clayey and / or silty sand. Environmental Survey Strategy: A total of 38 stations were sampled using a 0.1 m2 Day grab with one or three physicochemical replicates retained for analysis and three macrofaunal replicates obtained at 21 of the 38 stations. Seabed photography was undertaken at the required locations for groundtruthing purposes. Granulometry: The sediments were similar across the survey area ranging from poorly to very poorly sorted, fine to very fine sand, with the exception of station D4, which was classified as very poorly sorted medium silt. Mean phi ranged from 2.52 to 3.69 (station C9 and C4, respectively), while station D4 showed a mean phi of 5.27. The sorting coefficient ranged from 1.03 (stations D6 and Ref2) to 2.19 (station D4). In general variation in the particle size composition of sediments within the survey area appeared to relate to the proximity to the historic well locations. Drill cuttings were observed in many of the samples located adjacent to the historic well locations i.e. A3, A4, C4 and D2 to D5. Comparison of granulometry data with 1990 survey data showed that levels of fines appeared to have increased across the entire survey, although this is probably due to a change in methodology (the current survey utilised wet sieving techniques followed by laser diffraction). However, it was considered significant that the areas adjacent to the historic well locations showed a disproportionate increase in fines, presumed to be due to the presence of drill cuttings, which were not present in the 1990 baseline survey. Organic Carbon: TOM for the majority of sediments from the survey area ranged from 1.2% to 2.9% (stations A10 and C2, respectively). Substantially higher levels of loss on ignition were recorded for stations adjacent to historic well locations i.e. D4 and C4, at 4.6% including station A3 at 4.0%.

This large amount of noise may cause harmful damage to marine mammals in the near vicinity. This study examines the potential to create deterrent noise to move marine mammals away from the source of the damaging noise to prevent any injury.","A number of anthropogenic activities that occur in coastal and offshore waters generate soundor impulses at levels which are sufficiently high to pose a risk of causing physical damage orhearing impairment in sensitive wildlife such as marine mammals. The use of explosives, forexample, for well-head removal, certainly poses this risk and it is possible that pile drivingduring windfarm construction could also do so. One potential means of reducing the risk ofdamage to marine mammals from such activities is to move sensitive animals out of the highrisk area by using aversive or alarming sounds produced by an acoustic mitigation device(AMD). This report investigates the potential for using AMDs for mitigation during windfarmconstruction, explores the types of acoustic signals that might be suitable for this application,and the devices available for producing them in the field. It makes recommendations in relationto the areas of research that would be needed to develop and quantify the performance of aworking system, and reviews legal aspects of using AMDs for mitigation in UK waters.In the absence of clear criteria from regulators in the UK or Europe for unacceptable exposure,we have worked to two acoustic exposure thresholds proposed by NOAA in the USA. These arethat received levels for a single pulse should not exceed 180 dB re 1HPa for cetaceans and 190dBfor seals, and the cumulative exposure should not exceed 195 dB re 1HPa2s. A cumulativeexposure model which accounts for animal movements and propagation conditions as well assource levels and duty cycles of piling activities and AMDs was used to explore the ranges towhich animals would need to be moved to minimise the risk that these thresholds for acceptablenoise exposure would be exceeded. Ranges varied widely between different likely scenarios. Inpart this reflects sensitivity to factors such as propagation conditions which vary between sitesand with conditions, but which could be measured and more tightly defined in the model.However it is also the consequence of some fundamental unknowns, such as the behaviour ofanimals when exposed to aversive sounds and piling. The results from this modelling exerciseshould not be used to make firm predictions, but they do indicate that, whilst the risk of hearingdamage to marine mammals from piling activities cannot be discounted, it could be greatlyreduced if animals were induced to move out of the area before piling started. In typicalconditions animals would need to be moved over ranges of hundreds or low thousands ofmetres to achieve this, and this sets indicative performance criteria for an effective AMD",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,Y,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,Y,,,Y,,,,

Measurements were taken during the pile driving phase at NorthHoyle, Scroby Sands, Kentish Flats, Barrow and Burbo Bank. The noise created during the pile driving process can cause injury and harmful damage to marine mammals close to the turbines (100metres) and behavioural effects at ranges of the order of 10 kilometres or more. Measurements were taken at the NorthHoyle, Scroby Sands, Kentish Flats and Barrow offshore wind farms during the operation phase.

The results of monitoring during the second year of wind farm operation (September 2008 to April 2009) are presented here.Surveys were undertaken from a vessel which followed seven established set transects through the wind farm, buffer (edge of the wind farm) and reference areas. Two experienced ornithologists noted all bird species seen and also made observations on any marine mammals encountered.Analysis efforts are focused on four target species: common scoter, red-throated diver, cormorant and common tern. These species are important to local conservation sites such as the proposed Liverpool Bay SPA, Dee Estuary SPA and the Mersey Narrows and North Wirral Foreshore SSSI/candidate SPA.Previous reports have presented results of baseline and during construction ornithological surveys (2005/06 and 2006/07 respectively). This is the second set of post construction surveys. Five surveys were completed in 2008/2009, reflecting an agreement with statutory consultees to focus effort in months of interest (September to April). Subject to no significant adverse effects being identified there is an agreement to conclude the ornithological monitoring programme at this stage.Low numbers of birds were recorded in the survey, which continues to demonstrate that the area is not intensively used by seabirds. However, this year‚Äôs survey did provide the first evidence of birds (auks) present within the wind farm array area, assumed to be foraging. This was reflected as a shift in distribution rather than a marked change in abundance.There is no evidence from the surveys that continued operation of the wind farm has had any detectable adverse impact on local seabird use of the area.","This report focuses on numerical data derived from the field surveys and compares counts from the wind farm site and the control site to provide an indication of the effect of wind farm operation on bird presence and numbers. Comparison is also made with counts and distribution data gathered in pre-construction surveys.The data are presented in tabular format (Appendix A), giving a total number of individuals recorded for each species along each transect. The data were collected so as to allow the use of Distance software to calculate population estimates if required.

This aim of this work was to establish a baseline biological dataset that would: (1) facilitate the assessment of the favourable condition status of the habitats in the future; and (2) to allow a judgement to be formed on the current condition of these habitats. This work consisted of an extensive drop-down video drift survey at 135 sites, supplementary infaunal grab sampling of sediments at 30 sites, and a detailed reef and mixed reef/sediment habitat survey along 11 relocatable transects. Additionally, maerl bed dive transect surveys were performed at 3 maerl bed sites and the distribution of the unattached form of knotted wrack and beds of mussel was mapped.","This data was collected by SNH between the 2nd - 6th August 2009, from the vessel RV Serpula. This SCM survey was conducted using a combination of methods, including extensive drop-down video of sublittoral reef and sediment biotopes at 135 sites, infaunal grab sampling at 30 sites and 11 relocatable transects to survey shore and nearshore reef and sediment biotopes. Surveys were also performed at 3 maerl sites.  DDV and Diver Video Survey: The SAC was divided into six sectors, with 120 DDV sites allocated in proportion to area. The 2001 broadscale biotope map was used inform locations for examination in this survey, additional sites were also positioned within each sector to ensure good geographical spread and coverage of the range of biotopes, depths, exposure, and anthropogenic activities in the area. Video images were collected using a Panasonic NV-GS150 3 chip digital video camera. The video was recorded on a MiniDV tape. The camera was deployed for approximately 2-3 minutes from a drifting vessel at each station. positional and time/depth data were recorded at each station. 66 dive video sites were selected for examination from the 2001 broadscale survey sites. A further 3 sites were examined by spot dives on the 18th August 2009. At each site video images of the habitat were collected by one diver and biota present and substrate details were recorded by a second diver. On September 3rd 2009 a further 12 DDV sites (maerl bed adjacent to a fish farm) were surveyed by SNH on board the RIB Aphrodite, using a similar methodology to the main DDV survey. Video material was processed in a laboratory, with the SACFOR scale of abundance employed where possible during the analysis to quantify the species and substrate present. Based on the physical and biological attributes, biotopes were allocated. Stations were also characterized as 'reef', 'non-reef'. or 'mixed' habitats based on the presence of reef biotopes or a mixture of reef and non-reef biotopes.  Infaunal Grab: Grab survey carried out from the RV Serpula from 5th-7th August 2009 to provide information on the distribution and diversity of sediment biotopes. 21 sites were surveyed - the same sites as those visited in 2001 broadscale mapping survey. An additional 7 sites were sampled in 2009, making a total of 30 sites. These 30 sites were also surveyed in the video survey to facilitate biotope identification. A single 0.1m2 Van Veen grab sample was taken at each station. A 150ml subsample was taken from each grab for PSA analysis in the laboratory, and the remainder passed through a 1mm mesh. At 5 sites (representing a broad range of sediment types) the sediment was passed through a 0.5 mm sieve to enable comparisons with the 2001 survey. At one site, an additional macrobenthic sample was taken by diver. This consisted of 8 pooled 10.3 cm cores, sieved using a 1mm mesh. Macrobenthos samples were processed in the laboratory and identified to species where possible and counted.  Transect Survey: Nine reef and mixed reef/sediment transects were established (with one relocation due to adverse conditions). These transects represented a wide geographical and exposure range, allowing examination of the outer, middle, and inner loch and also comparison with previous data. The transect route at each site was marked by a 200m graduated line attached to the transect. The transect extended from the shore to the subtidal, where scuba divers laid it along the seabed. A band 2m either side of the tape was surveyed intertidally and subtidally using MNCR Phase 2 survey methodology. Within each zone (defined in terms of differences in the composition of biological community and/or substrate type) records were taken of biota and substrate type using the MNCR SACFOR scale of abundance. Video and still imagery were used to make representative visual recordings of the transect zones and biota. Maerl bed transect surveys were carried out by divers at the same three sites examined in the 2009 baseline survey. A 25m tape transect line was marked out and a 2m band either side of the tape was surveyed by divers using MNCR Phase 2 methodology. Presence and estimates of abundance of conspicuous biota were noted by two surveyors. Video footage and still photographs were collected to retain a visual record of the nature of the habitat and community for the purpose of supplementary material to aid habitat description. based on DDV results, 4 maerl sites were selected for examination. 4 replicate core samples were taken in areas of live maerl using a 10.3 diameter corer to a depth of 20cm.

All survey operations were conducted by contractors Seastar Survey Ltd from their vessel SV Otarie.","The North Rona BSM survey was divided into two phases; an acoustic survey and a ground-truthing survey. The objectives of the acoustic survey were to acquire bathymetric data using a dual frequency single beam echo sounder and high frequency sidescan sonar. The objectives of the ground-truthing survey were to acquire high resolution video and still photographs using a drop-down camera system and an ROV. Acoustic survey work was undertaken between 26th June and 2nd July 2009, onboard Seastar Survey Ltd's survey vessel RV Otarie. Ground-truthing survey work was undertaken later in the summer between 3rd and 13th August 2009 by the same contractors and survey vessel.  1) Acoustic survey work: acoustic field work was undertaken using a Leica 1200 RTK Rover GPS system, an EdgeTech FS 4200 dual frequency sidescan sonar system, and a Marimatech E-Sea Sound 206 dual frequency echosounder (33/200 kHz). The acoustic survey area was divided into three main areas (E, S, W) with 16, 20, and 13 planned acoustic lines in each, respectively, to simplify survey operations and ensure that the acoustic work was completed in its entirety within the SAC. Seabed backscatter data was collected using an EdgeTech 4200-FS dual frequency (120/410 kHz) sidescan sonar. Processing of the bathymetric data was undertaken using the post processing tools within the survey management software. This was undertaken with reference to the echo sounder paper trace records as part of our quality control procedures. 2) Ground-truthing survey work: fieldwork was undertaken using a Kongsberg OE 14-208 shallow water camera system mounted obliquely on a seabed camera frame. A flash unit and two sub-sea lights were also mounted on the frame. These units were linked to the surface with a soft umbilical cable. The shallow-water camera system was used for the ground-truthing of the sidescan sonar imagery. All camera deployments were established as transects across sites of interest, which were selected after scrutinising the acoustic survey data. The vessel was positioned at one end of a transect using DGPS. The camera was then deployed and lowered to the seabed. Once the camera system was at the seabed and had time to settle, the vessel drifted along the transect at approximately 0.5 knots. The camera frame was towed immediately above the seabed during the deployments, resulting in a seabed coverage of each still photograph of approximately 1 m2. Before each deployment a ?¢??clapper board?¢?? containing site name, date and weather conditions was videoed and photographed as a quality assurance (QA) record.",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infaunal samples were collected at 20 stations in the Southern Trench survey area using a 0.1m2 Day grab. Sampling stations for grabs were selected based on a subset of drop-down video sampling stations so as to increase sampling effort in areas where PMFs were most likely to occur. Single sediment grabs were collected at each station to gain a broad understanding of the biotopes present on the seabed. A small sub sample of each grab was taken for particle size analysis (PSA), before being sieved by hand through a 1mm mesh size.

This work was completed and the data delivered in September 2012.During subsequent work by RIL on the processed dataset, one seismic line was identified on which the the tidal correction diverged from the bathymetry. Subsequent testing undertaken as part of RIL‚Äôs ongoing QA/QC procedures revealed a further line exhibiting the same problem. Testing was undertaken and the cause of the issue was identified. These lines were two of the largest in the dataset, and there appears to have been a problem with the static processing failing because of this and applying a constant correction instead of the correct values. The two lines were split, reprocessed and re-joined, and it was confirmed that the tidal correction process had completed successfully on both lines.Further information is available in report: SE-D-EN-078-0000-000000-002",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A further aim was to validate records of four additional sublittoral mud and mixed sediment complexes that have been proposed as protected features within the possible MPA. Assessment of the condition of the targeted proposed protected features. This survey was split into two phases - (1) an underwater video survey and remote infaunal survey (grab and dredge) and (2) a MNCR phase 2 diving survey. An underwater video survey at 98 stations, infaunal grabs at 25 stations, naturalist dredge tows of a historical Limaria bed to supplement video samples, and single anchor dredges at 4 sites of historical Maxmuelleria were undertaken by Heriot-Watt University for SNH between the 18th and 21st March 2013. Between the 17th and 23rd April 2013, dive surveys of maerl, oyster and burrowed bud features of the the Loch, together with video and infaunal surveys of Linne Mhuirich. Detailed biological information were collected on the seabed species and habitat features present. Analyses on the seabed video and infaunal samples, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages.","This subtidal seabed data from Loch Sween was collected by SNH during two time periods in 2013. Phase 1 of the programme (18th-21st March) involved dropdown video and remote infaunal surveys of the Loch Sween system, apart from Linne Mhuirich. Phase 2 (17th - 23rd April) included principally diving surveys of the maerl, oyster and burrowed mud features of the loch, together with video and infaunal surveys of Linne Mhuirich and limited infaunal sampling elsewhere in the Loch Sween system. Survey methodology included drop-down and diver video, grabbing and dredging and diver surveying of maerl, burrowed mud and Ostrea edulis habitats, with collection of replicate core samples for infaunal analysis of the maerl beds. 98 sites were surveyed by drop-down video from RV Serpula. The video system used consisted of a Panasonic NV-GS150 3 chip digital video camera within a Seapro housing held within a frame and illuminated by twin 100 watt lamps. At each station the camera was deployed from a drifting vessel for between 3-8 minutes, and the times, depths and precise positions at the start and end of the drift using dGPS noted. Linne Mhuirich was inaccessible to RV Serpula so video runs were carried out by diving at six sites in this area using a hand-held HD video camera (Sony HD Model XR550). The video material from each station was processed in the laboratory; species present were identified and quantified using the semi-quantitative MNCR SACFOR scale, as far as possible. Where video runs traversed a sequence of biotopes, the runs are split into corresponding segments with the transition points recorded using time. Segmentation of runs was not practicable in the case of mosaics of recurring biotopes, in which case all biotopes observed were simply listed.  To assist in the process of biotope identification and condition assessment, single 0.1 m2 van Veen grab samples were taken at 25 stations with a c.150 ml subsample taken for particle size analysis and the remaining material sieved on a 1 mm mesh and preserved in buffered 5% formalin. In addition, a further three replicate grab samples were collected at one where there is a historical record of inshore deep mud. During phase 2 of the survey programme the infauna at four additional sites were examined using duplicate, pooled mini van Veen grab samples (total area 0.09 m2), with the contents of a third grab subsampled for particle size analysis. One naturalist dredge tow was carried out through an area of historical Limaria bed records to supplement video samples taken at the same location and single anchor dredge samples were also collected at four sites in areas of historical records of Maxmuelleria. MNCR phase 2 surveys were carried out by diving on good examples of the biotope SS.SMu.CFiMu.MegMax. A band 4 m either side of the 25m transect tape was surveyed by two divers, who noted the presence, and where possible, estimated the abundance of conspicuous biota, collecting material which needed to be identified in the laboratory. To supplement the real-time visual records and collections, the transect band was videoed using a hand-held digital HD video camera (Canon Legria HF S30) and still photographs taken of the habitat and associated community using two Fuji Finepix S2 Pro digital still cameras with 14 mm wide-angle and 90 mm macro lenses. All video footage was analysed by contractor Dr Colin Moore and the faunal samples were processed by Fugro EMU (Edinburgh).",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,Y,,Y,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natural England have a duty to assess the condition of the SACs features once every six years and have therefore established (in association with other countryside agencies), a series of common standards for the monitoring of sites of nature conservation interest.  These common standards apply to a number of statutory designated sites, including SACs, and are used in conjunction with other relevant guidance to ensure that a consistent approach is taken when monitoring these sites.the Inner Solway Firth SAC, the intertidal sandy mud communities which are a sub-feature of the mudflats and sandflats not covered by seawater at low tide qualifying habitat (Natural England &amp; Scottish Natural Heritage, 2010), fall under the Common Standards Monitoring (CSM) guidance produced for littoral sediment habitats (Joint Nature Conservation Committee, 2004).  For the purposes of monitoring, each feature of the SAC has an associated series of attributes which are measurable indicators of the condition of the feature at the site.  A target is set for each attribute which is considered to correspond to the favourable condition of the feature.Regulation 33 (2)(a) of The Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 (as amended), Natural England (NE) and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) have a duty to advise other relevant authorities as to the conservation objectives for the European Marine Site.  For the marine qualifying interests of the Solway Firth SAC (of which sandy mud communities are a sub-feature of the mudflats and sandflats not covered by seawater at low tidethe conservation objectives provided by NE and SNH (2010) are as follows: Subject to natural change, avoid deterioration of the qualifying habitat (Estuaries, Sandbanks which are slightly covered by seawater all the time, Mudflats and sandflats not covered by seawater at low tide, Reefs, Salicornia and other annuals colonising mud and sand, and Atlantic salt meadows (Glauco-Puccinellietalia maritimae)) thus ensuring that the integrity of the site is maintained and the site makes an appropriate contribution to achieving favourable conservation status for each of the qualifying interests.ensure for the qualifying habitats that the following are maintained in the long term:  d{Extent of the habitat on site.of the habitat within site.and function of the habitatsupporting the habitat.of typical species of the habitat.of typical species as components of the habitat.significant disturbance of typical species of the habitat.  dSurvey Aims and Objectives  dThe Inner Solway is designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), and the current study therefore forms part of a long term monitoring programme being jointly administered by Natural England (NE), and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) under the requirements of the Habitats Directive (and enabling UK legislation).  An intertidal biotope survey was undertaken by IECS on behalf of Natural England (then English Nature) in 2004, with the survey covering both the north and south banks of the Solway (Hemingway et al., 2006).  In 2011, the inner Solway together with the middle to outer south shore were again surveyed for biotope composition and extent (Cutts et al., 2011).current survey programme of intertidal biotope mapping work on the south shore of the Solway (survey effort and platform prescribed in the project specification) covered a similar area to that of the previous 2011 survey.  The ecological survey work was designed to monitor and assess the mudflats and sandflats not covered by seawater at low tide (intertidal mudflats and sandflats) of the Solway Firth SAC, and the survey objectives as defined under the project specification were therefore to report the following information:  d{Extent of the infaunal communities as estimated from line transects.characteristics (grain size, organic content, and depth of redox layer) along transects, and relationship to observed changes in biological community.biotope detail and spatial extent.and contrast changes in extent and type of biological communities and sediment character within previous studies from the same area (biotope status and change).  dMethodology  dSurvey  dThis involved the in situ field surveying and mapping of the soft sediment habitats of the intertidal zone of the study area in accordance with the agreed survey schedule using a hovercraft survey platform.  The survey transects (track files) undertaken during the Phase 1 survey are shown in Maps 2-4, covering the upper inner estuary (Old Graitney to Port Carlisle), lower inner Solway (Cardurnock Flatts &amp; Moricambe), and the middle estuary/open coast from Blitterlees Bank to Dubmill Point.  As noted above, the current methodology required a two phase survey effort, with the first phase involving a general characterisation of the area.  Based on the analysis of information derived from Phase 1, samples were subsequently collected at 20 stations during Phase 2 in order to fully describe the invertebrate and sediment conditions and the associated biotopes present.  Maps 2 to 4 show both the Phase 1 transects (with potential biotopes as identified on completion of Phase 1), together with the locations from which Phase 2 samples were taken for more detailed taxonomic analysis.1 sampling was undertaken between 16th to 19th June 2014 (inclusive), with Phase 2 undertaken on the 16th and 17th July 2014.  Table 2 above provides tide times (high and low water) for the nearest secondary ports to the survey locations.  Detailed In-field SamplingStandard NMBAQC and WFD protocols for sampling of benthic core samples and particle size analysis (PSA) were followed during the Phase 2 survey.  Twenty sampling stations were identified in order to provide core samples from each distinct biotope, these covering the inner to middle/outer estuary, and with the greatest sampling effort being in areas of highest biotope diversity.aim of the approach was to provide a combination of spatial coverage together with a degree of statistical robustness, allowing spatial and temporal comparisons with previous data/reports.each sampling station (located approximately in the centre of each distinct biotope or habitat), three replicate core samples (0.01 m2were taken to a depth of 15cm.  Samples were placed in pre-labelled plastic bags and transferred to labelled, clean plastic buckets at the end of each survey day.  At this point, the samples were fixed using 4% buffered formaldehyde solution.  An additional fourth core was taken for Particle Size Analysis with these samples being kept chilled until collection by the analysing laboratory.  Laboratory AnalysisInvertebrate taxonomic analysis of the replicate core samples was carried out under contract to Natural England by APEM Ltd (Edinburgh), APEM Report No. 413565-01 issued October 2014.

Site Check of the sediment flats involved checking the presence and sequence of biotopes along the five transects surveyed in 2003. This involved recording data at the 16 relocatable stations along each transect. The sediment type and depth of the anaerobic layer was recorded and the habitat photographed using stills and video cameras. Biota was assessed by digging over areas of sediment and recording abundance recorded on the SACFOR scale. A subsidiary aim of the survey work was to produce a biotope map of the sediment flats. This involved supplementing the Site Check data by walking over the area recording the nature of the substratum and conspicuous biota observed.","Data collection for the Site Check survey took place at a series of relocatable stations along transects, surveyed in 2003, that reflected the biological and environmental diversity of the intertidal sediment flats in the SAC. The 5 transects (MA to ME), which included a total of 16 sample stations, were laid out perpendicular to the shore and to low water channels at the seaward end. Each station lay within a perceived habitat zone identified from the physical appearance and biological surface features. The positions of both stations and zone boundaries were recorded. At each station, a record of any surfical biota was made by photographing five replicate randomly placed 0.25 m2 quadrats and noting incidental visual records. In addition, approximately 1 m2 of sediment was dug-over using a spade, to a depth of about 30 cm to check for the presence of conspicuous infauna and estimates of their density made using the SACFOR scale. Smaller infauna was similarly recorded but sampled by sieving, using a 1 mm mesh, an area of sediment of c. 250 cm2. All transects and stations had their positions fixed by hand-held differential GPS using WGS84 datum.  For biotope mapping of the sediment flats a wireframe map (of putative habitat polygons) with aerial imagery was available in the field on a series of laminated sheets. It was also uploaded to a large-screen, sunlight-readable, differential GPS receiver (Garmin Montana 600). One team of 2 - 3 recorders surveyed the area, largely within three hours either side of low water springs by walking each of the polygons where possible, employing target notes at fixed locations to record the characteristics of the habitat. Where appropriate, descriptions of habitats between target point positions were also recorded, with the surveyors' track continuously recorded by a GPS data logger. Field data collected to aid subsequent biotope identification included physical habitat characteristics, biotic surface features and the infauna revealed by digging over an area of c. 1 m2, with retention of specimens where necessary for laboratory identification. In many cases it was also felt necessary to supplement dig-over material by sieving sediment from an area of c. 250 cm2 using a 1 mm mesh. Field observations were supplemented by still and video photography. The wireframe laminates were used for sketching the distribution of perceived habitats in the field and to aid investigation of conspicuous features on the aerial imagery. In general, biotope ascription to areas was deferred until the results of infaunal analysis were available and, in view of the limited information available at individual target sites, biotopes were assigned to areas, rather than individual sites. The biotope mapping GIS project employed the OSGB 1936 coordinate system and British National Grid projection.",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reason for the variation is that Westermost RoughLtd. proposes that whilst the project does not expect to drill on more than a maximum of five foundationlocations during installation works for the Westermost Offshore Wind Farm, the project requires flexibility todrill any foundation should it be required as a contingency. The previous study (and this one) assumed all ofthe monopile would be drilled (rather than sections that cannot be driven through) and so is worst case. Thisstudy assumes surface release (so modelling is necessary) unlike the last one which released near bed andso could use the monitoring results of near bed release at Lynn and Inner Dowsing wind farm.The report within this series provides an updated assessment of potential physical impact of drill arisings for the five alreadyassessed and the other 30 foundations in the offshore wind farm.

Following over 18 months of engagement with the market and stakeholders, The Crown Estate has developed and refined its proposals for Leasing Round 4. The Crown Estate has published the detail of this work, as well the detailed data and analysis of constraints affecting the characterisation areas inside each of the Seabed Bidding Areas, to assist potential bidders in their preparations for Round 4.","The resource and constraints assessment completed by The Crown Estate is based on the following scope:‚Ä¢ Only investigating the ‚Äòfavourable‚Äô resource area for fixed foundation offshore wind3;‚Ä¢ No prerequisites in terms of size of turbines or project;‚Ä¢ Analysis is limited to consideration of offshore array i.e. excluding export cable routes and terrestrialinfrastructure; and,‚Ä¢ Analysis is limited to English, Welsh and Northern Irish waters.The analysis we have undertaken has been an internal process drawing on expertise and knowledge withinThe Crown Estate where available. It has then been subject to an external peer review process by EverozePartners Limited (technical resource area) and RPS Energy (constraints analysis).The analysis follows several steps, each of which focusses on progressively smaller, less constrained andtechnically attractive areas of seabed. The list below summarises each stage:‚Ä¢ Technical resource model: this is the starting point of the analysis and defines the area of seabedthat is most favourable for offshore wind development within the scope defined in section 2.1. Thismodel is mainly driven by water depth, wave climate and geology (note that the ‚Äòfavourable‚Äôresource area is only driven by water depth and wave climate).‚Ä¢ Exclusions model: this forms part of the constraints analysis and removes activities and receptorsthat will preclude development such as existing infrastructure and rights, and areas where healthand safety or policy reasons mean development is unfeasible. These activities and receptors (inputcriteria) in this model are termed ‚Äòhard constraints‚Äô.‚Ä¢ Restrictions model: this model includes all other criteria which are structured and weighted in termsof the constraint each presents to development. The input criteria in this model are termed ‚Äòsoftconstraints‚Äô.‚Ä¢ Characterisation areas: these are defined from the result of combining the first three stages in thelist. Detailed consideration and analysis has subsequently been performed on these areas. Theaspects that are introduced in this stage of work are termed ‚Äòreview layers‚Äô.",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the survey was initially to assess the distribution and abundance of native oysters (Ostrea edulis) within the Fal Fishery management area in the River Fal, Cornwall. Since 2016 the survey has been developed to also assess queenies (queen scallop, Aequipecten opercularis; variegated scallop, Mimachlamys varia) distribution and abundance. In 2018, an addition to the survey was made to record the number of individual slipper limpets (Crepidula fornicata) at each site. The aims of the survey were to investigate the relative abundance and distribution of native oysters (O. edulis), scallops (queen scallop, A. opercularis; variegated scallop, M. varia) and slipper limpets (C. fornicata) within the Fal Oyster Fishery. The distribution of substrate types across the fishery were also recorded at each site and species of bycatch were recorded across the survey area as a list of species present.  In 2023, a total of 81 sites were completed and a total of 2,007 oysters, 3,165 scallops and 3,410 slipper limpets were recorded. The analysis was done by Management Areas; A, B and C.","The positions of the survey sites were based on previous survey positions from surveys carried out by Cefas/ Cornwall Council prior to Cornwall IFCA taking over management of the fishery in 2014.  The survey was carried out onboard research vessel Tiger Lily VI. The oyster dredge used was an Essex-style oyster dredge with a 72 cm blade, rigged with 34 mm diameter steel belly rings and a 45 mm (twin 3 mm nylon twine) mesh back. The dredge was deployed and recovered using the A frame on the stern of Tiger Lily VI.  A target was created in Olex for each site position and a radius ring was added to ensure each tow was 50 m in length. A tow haul method was adopted, similar to that used by the oyster punts. This allowed the dredge tow to be of a known distance and to be easily and consistently replicated. At each survey site the survey vessel was anchored and 60 m of anchor line was let out. The dredge was shot by hand and the slave hauler winch was used to take up 50 m of marked anchor line, resulting in a 50 m dredge tow at a steady 0.5 to 1 knots. The towing warp was run via the A frame mounted hydraulic winch. The towing warp was marked off so that the length (m) of cable deployed at any time was known; this was generally fixed for an average depth and altered only if a depth change was sufficient to cause the dredge to fish too heavily or lightly. The dredge was recovered using the hydraulic winch and/ or A frame.  Once recovered, the dredge contents were emptied on to the sorting table. If the dredge did not fish, due to being blinded or flipped over, or the sample appeared smaller than it should be for particular areas, the dredge haul was repeated. A target was created in HYPACK MAX to indicate the start of line (SOL) and end of line (EOL). All positions were recorded using WGS84 projection and all times are recorded as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  Each sample was photographed on the sorting table alongside a clapper board prior to sorting. Live native oysters, queen scallops and slipper limpets were removed and set aside as the sample was sorted.  All live oysters and queen scallops were counted and measured across the widest point, to the nearest mm using Vernier callipers. The weight (g) was recorded for oysters where possible to the nearest 0.1g. All slipper limpets were counted, as individuals and as part of a chain.  Observations of the catch composition (substrate) were recorded for each dredge sample. A clapper board was filled out per site for the volume of the dredge as a percentage (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) of how full the dredge was when it was at the surface and the percentage composition for the following categories; mud, shell (live and dead), weed, gravel, vegetation (sticks and leaves), dead maerl and stone in increments of 5% so that the catch composition per dredge equalled 100%. The values for all measurements recorded were relayed verbally via video conferencing to a member of staff working from home who was recording the data into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. The size frequency distribution was graphed in Microsoft Excel and size class distribution plots were created in MapInfo Pro Advanced Version 17.0. Analysis was carried out comparing data from the management areas; A, B and C.

It was created to support prioritisation of first round applications to the Slurry Infrastructure Grant, which Defra launched in October 2022. It identifies designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in England which have known features sensitive to ammonia emissions and that currently exceed the threshold at which adverse effects are known to occur, called their critical level. These sites were then buffered by 2 km to identify priority areas for air quality improvements. * The technical document sets out the methods proposed for and selected to identify the sites most vulnerable to ammonia emissions in England to prioritise the Slurry Infrastructure Grantâ€™s first round applications.The method used was developed in consultation with an expert group made up of Air Quality specialists across Defra and its associated Arms-Length Bodies. The spatial layer contains embedded features from a number of datasets, however the original features have been heavily altered and none of the original attributes have been retained.

These datasets were intersected to identify sites where the ammonia concentration exceeded the critical level. These sites were then buffered by 2km.

","A list of known locations of vegetation types which can be categorised as AF or TMQB was generated using existing national and local datasets from Natural England and partner organisations, in conjunction with additional information held at Sheffield. Existing datasets and site knowledge were used together with aerial photography to compile GIS boundaries of stands or vegetation mosaics supporting target vegetation types. Where possible, the existing Natural England National Fen Inventory GIS polygons were reviewed and refined, and where qualifying vegetation occurs but does not coincide with existing National Fen Inventory polygons, new polygons have been digitised. The polygons have been captured as a stand-alone GIS layer. The attributes attached to each polygon include NVC type and notes relating to the vegetation (where information exists), as well as information about relevant meta-data. In addition, point data have been captured where grid references were available but where there was not enough additional information to delimit vegetation stand boundaries. There are several other additional categories included in the Annex 1 Habitat dataset; “Mollinia Meadows”, “Petrifying springs with tufa formation” & “Calcareous fen with Cladium”, these are not comprehensive categories and are mapped as a result of the other Annex 1 types.

Each site is categorised as either Ancient Semi Natural Woodland (ASNW), Restored Ancient Woodland Site (RAWS), Plantation on Ancient Woodland Site (PAWS) or Ancient Woodland Site of Unknown Category (AWSU). Initially all woods greater than 2 ha shown on the Ordnance Survey (OS) 1:25 000 1st Series maps surveyed between 1880 and 1960 were considered. Evidence as to which of these were ancient was provided by presence on the earlier 19th century OS 1st Edition Maps (surveyed 1805 - 1873; scale 1:63 360). The general presumption was that woodland on 1800s maps was ancient, unless there was other evidence that the wood originated between 1600AD and 1800. Supportive indications of ancient status included the wood's name, its situation in the landscape, and the nature of both the surrounding pattern of enclosure and the pattern of boundaries within the wood. Where available, field survey data such as the presence of indicator species, or other historical maps and documents were also used. In mountainous areas such as Wales the first edition Ordnance Survey 1 inch maps were hard to interpret because the heavy hatching used to indicate steep slopes tended to obscure tree symbols.","The areas of ancient woodland with non-native trees planted on them, termed Plantations on Ancient Woodland Sites (PAWS), and those areas of ancient semi-natural woodland (ASNW) were identified and delimited by using the latest Ordnance Survey maps and field survey records. The area of each was measured using a dot grid overlay on flat projections of the 1:25 000 1st series map. The results were presented as a series of reports and maps by administrative regions (counties). As new information has been received from surveys and ad hoc informants, the initial county inventories have been revised by adding or deleting sites, or by changing the classification of the growing stock. The Ancient Woodland Inventory (AWI) identifies woodlands that have had a continuous woodland cover for centuries. Studies show that these woodlands are typically of higher nature conservation value than those that have developed recently. In the 1980s the former Nature Conservancy Council instigated the AWI, which attempted to list all ancient woodlands in Britain. A baseline date of 1600 AD was adopted because reasonable maps were available from this time (in England, at least). 1600 AD however, was an arbitrary date, and there was no clear ecological cut-off. The AWI was always considered to be provisional and subject to refinement, and never a definitive listing of the ancient, or the 'best' woods. Between 2010 and 2011 Forestry Commission Wales (FCW) and Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) commissioned a revision of the AWI in Wales comparing the existing AWI and National Forest Inventory with the Epoch 1: 1st County Series Ordnance Survey maps in terms of identification of ancient woodland. Epoch 1 County Series maps provide a more reliable and comprehensive baseline than the AWI. Moreover, the Epoch 1 maps incorporate numerous practical advantages over the AWI in terms of their ease of use, accuracy and level of detail.",,Reviewed,Y,Y,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the early 1990s the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) has been a major supporter of studies that have recorded the distribution and abundance of marine mammals in Wales. These studies, often undertaken using dedicated networks of volunteers, have helped to inform conservation objectives for Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), monitoring targets and the assessment of proposed developments and impacts. This dataset brings together the best available effort-related survey data on marine mammals in Welsh waters and adjacent parts of the Irish Sea, to provide the highestresolution analysis carried out to date of the spatial and temporal variation in their distribution. The Atlas contains distribution maps, including variations both seasonally and over the long terms of the five most common species (harbour porpoise, bottlenose dolphin, short-beaked common dolphin, Risso's dolphin and minke whale). The purpose of this data capture is to describe the temporal distribution, spatial distribution and relative abundance of all marine mammal species sighted, detected or stranded in Welsh waters. This dataset is concentrated on species regularly sighted and is designed to help meet obligations under the EU Habitats Directive. In addition is help former Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) now Natural Resources Wales (NRW) advise on marine activities including renewable energy exploitation, fisheries, waterborne recreation and oil and gas exploitation. The study area consists primarily of Welsh territorial seas out to the median line with Ireland and the Isle of Man, and English territorial seas. It was assumed that data contributed were reliable with respect to species identification and had been checked for errors in date, time and position fields; however factors affecting sight ability, survey characteristics and ecological factors may have affected sighting rates. Survey effort remains inadequate in all but a few small areas.","As with almost any data covered in the marine environment, there are variations in, coverage and confidence levels. Great care has been taken in the analysis to minimise errors by. The maps have been carefully interpreted, counting for variations in effort and other factors. Sixteen groups or survey projects have contributed to the project database that forms the basis of this Atlas. The minimum requirement for data contributed to the project were that they should include associated effort data, including data for effort periods when no sightings were made and that the effort data should include records of sea state. Approximately 216,031 hours of effort are from vessel and aerial surveys and 133,999 hours of land based effort are analysed spanning a 20 year period. The project database contains 12 species. In addition the Welsh Strandings Database managed by Marine Environmental Monitoring was reviewed. As well as this grey seal data were sourced from CCW comprising of approximately 3500 individuals. A grid with resolution of 10' latitude and 10' longitude was used, and effort partitioned into segments that could be assigned to a particular grid cell. Effort and sightings formed three separate tables (vessel, aerial and land) and these were then linked to a third table holding data on position and sea area of each cell. Count rates of animals at the surface were calculated for the 5 regular species. Edition 1 of the Atlas was produced in 2009. The report and data was subject to a detailed peer review by international scientificexperts with the supervision of CCW and JNCC staff. A second edition of the Atlas was subsequently produced in 2012.

122,122,NE Sample,Natural England,biota ,deciduous woodland,BAP Priority Deciduous Woodland v2.1,Bap Habitats Deciduous Woodland,"This is a spatial dataset that describes the geographic extent and location of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan combined broadleaved woodland priority habitat (lowland beech and yew woodland, lowland mixed deciduous woodland, upland mixed ashwoods, upland oakwood and wet woodland) in England. This inventory replaces Natural England's separate woodland BAP inventories (lowland mixed deciduous woodland, wet woodland, lowland beech and yew woodland, upland mixed ash woodland and upland oakwood). These earlier inventories were derived from Ancient Woodland Inventory polygons, attributed using SSSI and Phase II survey data and ecological modelling of habitats. The inventory provides England-wide coverage of semi-natural habitats and provides more comprehensive coverage than the previous separate inventories. An inclusive policy has been adopted, assuming that woodlands classed as one of the above categories (i.e. non-plantation) fall with one of the Habitat Action Plan woodland categories. The data is derived from the National Forest Inventory (NFI). It includes the following categories:Broadleaved (B) - The canopy of broadleaved woodland is generally more uneven than that of coniferous woodland being made up of rounded crowns but with variations according to species, age, height, and season. Boundaries with adjacent internal polygons are generally less clearly defined than with conifers and naturally occurring stands may grade into adjacent ones with no sharp division. Some coniferous trees may be present but greater than 80% of the area will consist of broadleaved trees.Mixed (Mb) - Predominantly broadleaved. The interpretation of Mixed woodland can be very difficult as it exhibits intermediate characteristics between Conifer and Broadleaved woodland. There can be several types of mixed woodland. A plantation of alternate rows of conifer and broadleaves may produce a 'striped' appearance. You may see conifer and broadleaves planted in blocks, and there may be general intersperse woodland. The proportion of the Broadleaves will be more than 50% of the area and less than 80%.Coppice (O) - The most important characteristic of coppice areas on aerial photographs is its very even, smooth appearance. The coppice area may be made up of a patchwork of different ages (heights) but all show this very even character. Areas recently cut may appear to have a very clear floor with little felling debris.Coppice-with-Standards (P) - Some areas of coppice also include larger broadleaved trees set in the coppice matrix. These broadleaved trees, often oak, are known as standards and show very clearly over the even coppice as large rounded crowns. The distribution of the standards may also be fairly scattered with approximately 25 per ha.The National Forest Inventory was interpreted based on:• Ordnance Survey MasterMap® (OSMM), features have been used as a reference for capturing the woodland boundaries.• The woodland boundaries were interpreted from colour aerial orthophotographic Imagery. The photographic images aimed to be no older than 3 years at the time of creating the digital map.• A minimum area of 0.5 hectares under stands of trees with, or with the potential to achieve, tree crown cover of more than 20% of the ground.• Areas of young trees, which have the potential to achieve a canopy cover of more than 20%, will also be interpreted as woodland and mapped.• All woodland (both urban and rural, regardless of ownership) which is 0.5ha or greater in extent has been mapped Woodland, those which are less than 0.5ha in extent will not be described within this dataset.Miscellaneous adjustments to original aerial photography interpretation (API) have been made as detected by Survey Foresters, Woodland Grant Schemes (1992 to 2002) and additional aerial photography interpretation update for part of North England (flown 1999-2000).In total 214848 polygons were captured, covering approximately 808,858.89Ha. ",All data is captured to the Ordnance Survey National Grid sometimes called the British National Grid using the OS MasterMap Topographic Layer. ,,Reviewed,Y,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By protecting these species and habitats MCZs will contribute to a network of MPAs in the UK, together with existing MPAs (European Marine Sites, and marine elements of SSSIs and Ramsar sites) and other national designations being planned in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This means the MPA network will be a collection of areas that work together to provide more benefits than an individual area could on its own.

Estimates of the benthic productivity associated with such communities were also derived, for the first time, at this large spatial scale.","The main purpose of this project was to assess the spatial distribution of the macrofaunal assemblages currently around the coast of England, Wales and the west coast of Scotland, together with an assessment of the factors affecting such assemblages. The project was intended to help underpin the State of the Seas report and to help manage the anthropogenic changes in the marine environment. This was part of a large scale sampling programme around the UK, spanning 2000-2009.Most of the sampling was conducted aboard the RV *Cefas Endeavour* using a variety of methods deemed compatible with the sedimentary habitat being targeted. At each station three replicate samples was collected, all within close proximity of each other. From each sample, a sub-sample of sediment was removed for sediment particle size distribution analysis. Macrofauna were extracted by sieving the collected sediments and viewing the residue under light magnification. Animals were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and each taxon enumerated and weighed.Tidal parameters were generated using a 3D hydrodynamic model (Davies and Aldridge, 1993), run in depth-integrated form on an approximately 3.5 km resolution grid covering the European continental shelf. Average and peak wave stress were calculated from a one-year model run covering the period September 1999 to September 2000, on an approximately 12km grid, using the WAM spectral wave model run at the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory.Surface chlorophyll a concentration images, derived from MERIS satellite ocean colour data using the ‚ÄòChlorophyll-II‚Äô algorithm for case-II waters (Doerffer and Schiller, 2007), were used to derive mean surface chlorophyll a concentrations between 2002 and 07Productivity estimates (i.e., P:B ratio (yr-1) and total production (kJ m-2 yr-1)) were derived in a stepwise approach from the raw abundance and biomass data (for Objective 5).

Sea-bed sediments can only be mapped offshore, where the most recent deposits commonly form a veneer or superficial layer of unconsolidated material on the sea-bed. The dataset is produced for use at 1:250,000 scale. The boundaries between sediment classifications or types are delineated using sample station particle size analyses and descriptions, seafloor topography derived from shallow geophysical data and where available multibeam bathymetry and backscatter and side scan sonar profiles. The sediment types present on the sea-bed are of importance to a range of groups, including marine habitat mappers, marine spatial planners, the offshore construction and development sector, and the dredging and aggregate industries.

The regions are based on National Character Areas which are grouped such that each region is covered by a single European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellite orbit (with the exception of Zone 10 in the SE which is covered by two orbits), and such that the regions are approximately similar in size.","For the purposes of data processing and habitat classification, England was divided into 14 Biogeographic Zones (BGZs). National Character Areas, which consists of 90 terrestrial regions based on their cultural and natural characteristics, were used as the basis of defining the zones and are available under an OGL. These were grouped into BGZs such that each zone was covered by the same Sentinel-2 orbit, and that the zones were approximately similar in size. The total number of BGZs was chosen to balance resource requirements (the number of individual zones needing to be handled) versus scalability (the maximum area that could realistically be processed at a time). All of these zones fall within a single Sentinel-2 orbit, with the exception of BGZ 10 where two of the Natural Areas span more than one Sentinel-2 orbit. The initial BGZ boundaries were expanded to include intertidal and coastal regions where each zone was buffered by 3 km, before manual post-processing ensured there was no overlap between adjacent zones. Where necessary, editing has been used to alter the polygons to remove complex features (e.g. estuaries) when these occurred at the boundary between BGZs.",Y,Boundary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project was also supported by the European Commissionâ€™s Life programme. The Firth of Lorn study area was selected by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) because it encompassed a wide range of physical environmental conditions and had considerable existing conservation value. Part of the BMP study area was recently put forward as a possible Special Area of Conservation in recognition of the significant marine biological interest of both intertidal and subtidal rocky reefs. A nested survey strategy was developed for the Firth of Lorn which involved careful pre-planning and iterative field survey. By adopting this nested and iterative approach, the overall summary maps comprise a jigsaw of small maps where the underlying data vary in their level of detail. The main features and biota were mapped using  acoustic remote sensing techniques combined with biological sampling. Linking the biological data with the acoustic data was completed using classification techniques developed for processing satellite images.Additional information source:Davies, J., 1999.

Climate Change Agreements (CCAs) are voluntary agreements that set targets on operators to improve their energy efficiency and/or reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The CCA scheme runs from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2025.  Eligibility to participate in the scheme requires operators to carry out one or more listed ‘eligible activities’. Operators that enter into and abide by the terms and conditions of their CCA are entitled to claim a discount on the Climate Change Levy (CCL), a tax added to electricity, gas and solid fuel bills by suppliers.  Operators must report their energy consumption, carbon emissions and performance against their target for each of the four biennial target periods between 2013 and 2020.  Operators meeting their target at the end of each target period will be certified as eligible to claim a discount on the CCL. This data set contains the performance results for each target unit participating in the CCA scheme.  A target unit is a group of one or more facilities operated by the same legal entity and set out in an underlying agreement held by the operator.

","DESCRIPTIONData, maps and figures for climate suitability of UK species in current and future climate scenarios (2 and 4 degree) at a 10km resolution. To assess the impacts of changing climate (measures of summer and winter temperature, seasonality and moisture availability) on the distribution of these species, we used spatially explicit Bayesian hierarchical models as described by (Beale et al. 2014). Using occupancy models combined with taxa specific estimates of observer effort, we calculated the probability of presence independently of the probability of observation. Full details are provided in Pearce-Higgins et al. (2015) and Oliver et al (2016).Climate suitability are values between 0 and 1, relating to the probability of occurrence per 10km grid cell; high values represent areas of higher climate suitability. Six types of figures have been created:  (1-3) climate suitability for the current and future climate scenarios (2 (low) and 4 (medium) degree change) (4-5) difference between current and future climate scenarios (6)   combined map of current suitability, 2 degree suitabilty and change between current and 2 degree suitability.We also provide the maps as GeoTIFF files for the current, 2 and 4 degree scenarios - values between 0 and 1, relating to the probability of occurrence per 10km grid cell; high values represent areas of higher climate suitability for that species.Species distribution data for the UK were acquired from the Biological Records Centre and British Trust for Ornithology.FOLDER STRUCTURE / FILE NONMENCLATUREFirst level: Supporting InformationSecond level: Taxonomic Group [grp]Third level: PDF maps - [species]_[maptype]Forth level: GeoTiff files - [species]_[maptype Gtiff][grp]    Taxonomic group ()[species]  Species (English name_Latin binomial or Latin binomial)[maptype] PDF map output: ""Current"", ""2 degree"", ""4 degree"", ""2 degree_change"", ""4 degree_change"", ""Combined""[maptype Gtiff] GeoTIFF output: ""Current"", ""2 degree"", ""4 degree"", ""2 degree change"", ""4 degree change"".Each zip file contains a set of pdfs and folder of GeoTIFF files.PDF maps and GeoTiffs can be extracted from the zip file using a utility such as PeaZip or 7-Zip.MAP DETAILSProjection: The maps use an OSGB 1936 projection which is embedded in the GeoTiff files.Spatial extent: xmin - 110000  xmax - 660000  ymin - 10000  ymax - 1060000Resolution:  10000mReferencesBeale, C.M., Lennon, J.J. & Gimona, A.

Household_solid_waste_audit_Belize_data.csv reports solid waste abundance and composition data from households expressed in number of items, weight or volume; and Commercial_solid_waste_audit_Belize_data.csv reports solid waste abundance and composition data from commercial activities. Household_solid_waste_audit_Belize_metadata.csv reports the results of interviews done when solid waste samples were collected to gather information about household occupants social status and behaviour, including the fate of solid waste not collected through the official waste management service. Commercial_solid_waste_audit_Belize_metadata.csv reports information about number of employees, type of business and waste collection and disposal collected through interviews. Household waste audits were conducted in eight communities between May and June 2019 in Belize (Belmopan, Mahogany Heights, Dangriga, Corozal, Belize City, Orange Walk, Bullet Tree Falls in Cayo, and Toledo rural). Commercial activities were also audited in five locations (Belmopan, Belize City, Corozal, Dangriga and Punta Gorda). A total of 268 households and 64 commercial activities were audited. Also, 12 samples were collected in Belize City to analyse the litter swiped from streets by city council contractors. A READ-ME text file contains the description of columns content for the two csv files.","The Commonwealth Litter Project (CLiP) supported Belize to take action on plastics entering the oceans. Currently 80% of marine litter is estimates to be originated on land and Cefas contracted Asia Pacific Waste Consultants to assess the land waste production rates and waste management performances. The sample collection was limited by the ease of collection of samples, the ability to transport samples, as well as the presence and absence of collection systems. Domestic waste samples were collected household by household targeting low-, medium- and high- income areas to determine waste generation and disposal rates. In areas with house-to-house collection system, the waste bags ready for collection by the waste truck were collected and the household occupiers were interviewed. This was the same protocol followed to sample comemrcial activities. In areas with no collection system, each household was provided with a bag to use to dispose of their waste. Bags were retrieved after one day and discarded to avoid biases in the data linked to the disposal of bulky and unusual items. A second bag was then provided, collected after 5 days and analysed. An interview was conducted with the member of the household depositing the bag. Local staff members were trained to undertake the interview. All waste was collected in labelled plastic bags that were individually opened to sort their contents into categories. Separated materials were weighed on a set of electronic scales. Beverage containers were stored and counted separately. Containers were sorted by size, material (e.g. plastic, aluminium) and product type (e.g. milk, juice). Further, all plastic bags were sorted into different types of bags and all containers were further sorted by size, material type and product type. Cigarette butts, coffee cups and takeaway containers were also segregated. Data quality was checked at several stages by Asia Pacific Waste Consultants before submission of the final version of the dataset. Data were checked during entering for completeness and adjust possible errors. Anomalies were also investigated.",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,,,,,,

Density separation using NaCl solution and a centrifuge, filtering the supernatant. This was followed by a chemical digestion with a KOH:NaClO solution for 3 days at 50 degrees centigrade whilst shaking. Plastic particles were then stained with Nile Red dye and a digital image was acquired through a microscope. Microplastic particles were then counted and a subsample of particles (between 1 and 10 percent) was processed through a ATRâ€”FTIR to identify particle composition comparing their spectrum to a polymers library.

An exception is water from a mine that was abandoned before 31 December 1999.  Any mine abandoned after this date is not covered by this exception.‘Controlled waters’ include virtually all freshwaters, ground waters, tidal and coastal waters to a distance of three nautical miles out to sea.  Exceptions include small ponds and reservoirs that do not supply water to other watercourses.  Public water supply reservoirs are controlled waters. There are over 100,000 Consented Discharges to Controlled Waters for effluent discharges from a wide range of public, private and industrial sectors, discharging into freshwater, estuarine, coastal waters and groundwater in England and Wales. A portion of these are ""significant"" continuous discharges and require monitoring or inspecting.The Consented Discharges to Controlled Waters dataset contains information on authorised discharges of effluents to the controlled waters.  These data have been extracted from the national WIMS (Water Information Management System) database.  Data stored on WIMS is entered from applications made by members of the public, companies and other bodies seeking to obtain authorisation. Applications for consent are assessed and granted or refused based on this assessment. Only when an application is granted will it appear on in the Discharge Consent dataset.WIMS is a live system and it is continuously updated, as such, the dataset represents all the permit data on the system at the time of the extraction.  The dataset  is updated quarterly for release to external sources.The Consented Discharges to Controlled Waters national dataset is extracted from WIMS in an automated process, using SQL code..

This information formed part of the Tenth UK Report for Article 12 of the EU Birds Directive (2008-2012).  This  applies only to those species on the checklist of SPA trigger species.The main purpose of the reporting under this field is to obtain information to allow for a â€˜broad-brushâ€™ but informative overview of the measures taken inside and outside the Natura 2000 network, and with reference to importance and effectiveness. The current format and codified list of conservation measures (to be found in the Reference Portal, http://bd.eionet.europa.eu/activities/Reporting/Article_12/reference_portal.  Appendix 1) aims to facilitate reporting in a more harmonised way and to promote further use of the data reported, namely as part of the process to evaluate the contribution of the SPA network to maintaining or improving the condition of bird species.The dataset on measures includes the *type of measure using the following categories. a) Legal/statutory b) Administrative c) Contractual d) Recurrent e) One-off*ranking of the importance of the measure (high medium or low)*location of the measure (inside or outside the SPA network)*effectiveness of the measure The following categorisation of UK activities was developed for guidance with respect to the conservation measure â€˜typeâ€™ field.*Legal/statutory: Existing and proposed (if underway) legally protected areas; legally protected species; abstraction licences; discharge consents*Administrative: Water Level Management Plans; NNR management plans; Catchment Sensitive Farming (where no specific project with a landowner); Species Recovery Projects (where no specific contract with third party)*Contractual: Agri-environment: (O)ELS, (O)HLS, classic schemes; Conservation and Enhancement Scheme (CES); Catchment Sensitive Farming (where a specific agreed project with landowner; Species Recovery Project (where a specific contract/agreement with third party)*Recurrent: Needing to be repeatedly implemented during reporting cycle e.g. habitat management activity* ne-off: Implemented once during reporting cycle e.g. Capital Works projects; Infrastructure; agri-environment HLS special projects linked to specific positive outcomes for the species","The dataset on conservation measures is based on the guidance from the EU accesible from this pagehttp://bd.eionet.europa.eu/activities/Reporting/Article_12/reference_portal. As for Pressures &amp; Threats, conservation measures are only required to be assessed for those species for which SPAs have been classified.  Additional guidance provided by the EU late in the process of compiling the draft report, made clear that such conservation measures included not only activities initiated during the 2008-2012 reporting period, but also earlier commencing activities that were still being implemented.  To this end, all species have thus been indicated as being subject to statutory protection (all are listed by domestic wildlife legislation) and subject to the provisions of protective areas (all have at least one SPA as well as coverage within the SSSI/ASSI network).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of templates are populated by submitting officers and submitted to the database which has in-built data restrictions and a data filter to ensure high quality, accurate data are submitted. The data filter has formulae in-built which use Accredited Quality Control information from known standards, limits, standard deviations and/or inter laboratory calibration exercises to calculate a score. Only data that pass a threshold agreed with the national advisory bodies are used for assessments. The data for 1999 - 2017 were extracted from MERMAN on 27 June 2019.  Further data checks were made and records with obvious errors were deleted or corrected.  The concentration and biological effects data were standardised to agreed units and bases and, in the case of sediment, were normalised to 5% aluminium (metals) and 2.5% organic carbon (organics).  The data were grouped into time series, typically of a single contaminant in a single species at a single monitoring station.  Time series with no data for the period 2012 - 2017 were excluded.

They are public green spaces often at the edge of urban areas which provide places to enjoy the outdoors and experience nature in an informal semi-rural park setting. Country Parks normally have some facilities such as a car park, toilets, perhaps a cafe or kiosk, paths and trails, and visitor information. There is not necessarily public right of access, although most are publicly accessible; some charge entry others do not. Most are owned and managed by Local Authorities. Many Country Parks were designated in the 1970s by the then Countryside Commission, under the Countryside Act 1968. More recently Country Parks have been created under a less formal arrangement and Natural England is working with partners to encourage a renaissance and accreditation of parks which meet certain criteria.

A review of environmental statements produced for offshore oil and gas developments found that none addressed cumulative impacts over the projects lifetime or with regards to adjacent existing or proposed developments. It can therefore be said that cumulative impacts from marine activities have seldom been adequately addressed in EIAs for offshore projects.

The study area is located within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in the southeast Pacific, Drake Passage and Scotia Sea regions of the Southern Ocean. Data collection began in December 2009 and ended in April 2014. The data were collected via a combination of research cruises in the southern hemisphere summer seasons. Three cruises were intended (UKD-1, UKD-2 and UKD-3) a further three cruises were completed (UKD-2.5, UKD-4 and UKD-5). Shipboard data collection involved the deployment of conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) packages, accompanied by lowered acoustic Doppler current profilers (LADCPs), and Vertical Microstructure Profilers (VMPs) in a grid pattern across the study area. Continuous measurements of current velocities (using vessel mounted ADCPs, VMADCPs), bathymetry and surface ocean and meteorological properties were collected throughout each cruise. An inert chemical tracer (sulphur hexafluoride, SF6) was released into the ACC in early 2009, and subsequent cruises measured temporal changes in the tracer distribution via the analysis of water samples collected at CTD stations. In addition, a mooring cluster was deployed in Drake Passage in early 2009 provided approximately two years' worth of hydrographic time series data. Floats and drifters were also deployed in the 2009 and 2010 seasons. The DIMES project aims to enhance understanding of mixing processes in the Southern Ocean, as it is thought that such processes may significantly affect ocean energetics and property balances, and thus have implications for the accuracy of climate models. DIMES brings together researchers from both UK and US institutions, including the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), the University of East Anglia (UEA), British Antarctic Survey (BAS), the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS), Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), Scripps Institute of Oceanography, Florida State University, the University of Washington and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Videos and stills subsequently analysed by Coastal Assessment, Liaison and Monitoring, under contract to CCW, to describe habitats, species and biotopes. The purpose of this data capture was to improve CCW's seabed habitat maps in those areas. 4 sites off the north coast of Pen Llyn, between Porth Dinllaen and Porth Colman, and 22 sites distributed around the northern half of Tremadog Bay.","Drop down video survey was conducted from Countryside Council for Wales' (CCW) survey boat Pedryn, an 11.7 m Delta cabined RIB. The CCW camera system is C-Vision HD with a C-vision mantis HD camera video recorder, a 200 m umbilical cable, a video camera in a waterproof housing mounted on a metal frame sled with two HID lights mounted on either side of the camera. In addition, a laser scaling device comprising two parallel laser beams, 10 cm apart, provide an indication of size and scale. The auto stills camera is a Seacam Digital still camera (18 mega pixel CMOS chip) with dual Seabeam underwater Strobe lamps. The surface control unit overlays realtime data such as time, date, depth of camera and position of vessel on the captured video which are recorded to the miniDV recorder. The camera was towed for approximately ten minutes at each location, recording continuous video plus still images every 10 seconds. The sled was towed at 0.5-1.0 knot (ideally) across the seabed either by drifting with the currents or using the drive of the vessel. A manual log was kept of the position and depth at the start and end of transect plus details of substratum type and main taxa observed on the screen during the tow. Video and stills were subsequently analysed by a experienced marine biological surveyor to record information on habitat character, conspicuous species and their abundance (SACFOR scale), and to assign biotopes from the national biotope classification.

This product shows the likely locations and boundaries of dune slacks for sites around England. A dune slack is a depression in coastal dune system.It is based upon a morphological definition of dune slacks and uses LIDAR Digital Terrain Model (DTM) data and a derived slope model. Each slack has height statistics calculated for it. The data are provided in Polygon Shapefile format. Geographical coverage is incomplete because of limits in data available.

INFORMATION WARNING This product shows likely locations of dune slacks using a morphological definition. Dune slack boundaries based upon phytological associations may differ to this product. This is particularly important to remember where sand dunes are covered by large extents of scrub or woodland, as through the use of the LIDAR DTM, slacks can be identified under scrub and tree vegetation. However this also gives the product unique advantages in considering vegetation recovery after scrub or tree clearance.",Dune slacks were identified using LiDAR derived products. These include a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Slope model. To identify and locate dune slacks we defined them morphologically. This definition was then used to set conditions which would identify potential dune slacks within the boundaries of the dune system and remove areas that were unlikely. Height statistics derived from the DTM were then used to remove slacks that did not meet set conditions. The areas resulting are therefore likely to be dune slacks. Critical evaluation was then carried out with edits being made to create the final product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data were collected as a series of triplicate 25 m x 2 m transecs parallel to shore, at three locations on the reef flat: near (70 m from the shore), mid (140 m from the shore) and far (210 m from the shore). All locations were at similar depths of 1 m. This took place during March 2015. Along each transect the number and size of all coralliths and total number of non-free living individuals were recorded, alongside with several environmental parameters (Water Temperature, Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR), Total Alkalinity, Dissolved Inorganic Carbon and Dissolved Oxygen). Abundance and size of coralliths was recorded through non-invasive techniques and the environmental parameters were obtained through multiple instruments: Fluorometer, Oxygen sensor, spectrophotometry, Titration and a PAR logger. The aim was to examine whether corals have the capacity to create their own stable habitat through 'free-living stabilisation'.

Dataset contains existing sites of dredging activity in the North East, North West, South East and South West Marine Plan areas","To map the existing sites of dredging activity and where dredged material has been used beneficially, digital spatial extent data provided by the MMO was imported into the GIS with associated metadata. Two separate datasets were provided by the MMO; one containing historic and existing dredging activities, and the other containing historic and existing beneficial uses. The data supplied was exclusively Marine Licences and Applications since 2011, split into point data, line data and polygonal data. The data was checked visually, and a review of the tabulated data was completed to identify any anomalies. Anomalies included applications for licences which have not yet been granted. These projects were transferred into the relevant ‘future sites’ dataset, along with any projects labelled ‘alternative use’ which were not (this included several which were disposal licences, as well as aggregate licences). The data provided by the MMO did not include details on material type and volume. Hence, these data were collated using the MMO public register for the sites where licences have not yet expired, and included as part of the metadata. These data were not obtained for those sites where licences have expired, as this was outside the scope of this study. Data was gathered on potential future dredging and beneficial use sites through desk-based assessment of key strategic documents and stakeholder engagement. This has been informed by Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs), Estuary Management Plans (EMPs), Beach Management Plans (BMPs), and industry documents such as Port Master Plans. Two main tasks were completed to compile the data. Potential sites for beneficial use of dredged material were identified using a combination of existing knowledge, a review of management plans, and the MMO public register. Areas of the coast which may make use of dredged material for beneficial use were identified using the policy adopted within each Policy Unit of the relevant SMPs and EMPs. All the Policy Units which identified a potential opportunity for beneficial use of dredged material were collated, including sites where the preferred management policy is Hold the Line involving beach nourishment. In addition, potential sites of sandscaping (large-scale beach nourishment) were identified and integrated into the dataset along with applications for beneficial use on the MMO public register.

Estates, Forest Planning, MGIU and ESRI (UK) Ltd have developed the Deed Management Extension. It has been designed to: N enable the Mapping & Geographic Information Units to interrogate and maintain the Forestry Commission's land holdings records N provide land ownership data to Estates staff with GIS N produce update polygons to maintain legal boundary information in the Forest District's 'Forester' GIS system The Deed Management System application is packaged as an ArcView 8 extension. It links ArcView 8 GIS and ORACLE (a relational database management system, or RDMS). Spatial information (polygons covering acquisitions and disposals of land areas, FC accesses, FC servitudes, legal boundaries) and deeds database information (attributes) are all managed within ArcView 8. The use of ArcSDE software sitting on a server in each territorial MGIU location further enhances the system by storing both the spatial data and the deeds attribute data in the same Oracle file, which also allows multi-user access to the data. The use of SDE also means backup arrangements are easier, since both the spatial and attribute data are backed up at the same time. Maintenance Functions in the Deed Management Extension: N Deed Identification N New Deed Creation N Editing of Existing Deeds N Deletion of Deeds N Creation of Information Points N Analysis of Deeds Data N Forest District A and D Layer Creation N Ownership Layer Creation (current land holdings) N Legal Boundary Layer Creation Create Legal Boundaries Generates a layer showing our current legal boundaries, by Forest District.

396,396,NE Sample,GeoSmart Limited,environment,Geographic Information,GEOSMART DEPTH TO WINTER GROUNDWATER TABLEMAP,GW50,"This dataset was developed using GeoSmart's peer-reviewed methodology for deriving groundwater flooding risk maps, except that in this case typical high winter or spring conditions are represented rather than extreme flooding conditions.Two mechanisms for high groundwater levels are considered:1) Equilibrium with high river levels in superficial deposits:In permeable superficial deposits that are in hydraulic continuity with rivers, and particularly those which are underlain by impermeable layers, groundwater levels are controlled by direct recharge from rainfall and by exchange with rivers. As rivers integrate recharge from a large catchment, river levels can rise at a faster rate than groundwater levels, such that they become the dominant source of recharge to the shallow aquifers. Groundwater levels rise in response to recharge from rivers, tending towards an equilibrium with river levels.2) Recharge leading to high groundwater levels in bedrock aquifers:Reduced evapotranspiration during winter leads to increased groundwater recharge, raising the water table in permeable bedrock aquifers such that it reaches its annual peak in winter or spring.For full report see “R65252.07R1_Guidance_Vn1” pdf.","Groundwater levels in superficial deposits are estimated by assuming that they are in hydraulic continuity with water levels in rivers. The topographic dataset used is the July 2016 release of the Ordnance Survey (OS) Terrain 50 digital terrain model (DTM), which is available on a 50m grid and has a vertical precision of 0.1m. This DTM was used to derive a national groundwater level map for a typical winter. River channels were derived from the DTM by assuming a threshold catchment size of 0.5 km2 for the initiation of channel formation. This catchment size is assumed to be suitable for representing river networks in areas of low permeability bedrock.Groundwater levels were estimated by using 2-D interpolation between river bank elevations and coastline elevations. The coastline was defined based on the high water line included in the OS Boundary Line dataset (January 2016 release). For areas underlain by permeable bedrock formations, the corrected BGS dataset on average high bedrock groundwater levels was used. For areas underlain by low transmissivity bedrock, and for which BGS data on bedrock groundwater levels was not available, our modelled groundwater surface based on estimated river levels and coastline elevations was used. In this way, a national dataset of average high winter-time groundwater levels was derived.Unsaturated zone thickness was derived as the difference between groundwater elevation and ground elevation from the Terrain 50 DTM.For full report see “R65252.07R1_Guidance_Vn1” pdf.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is designed to provide an accurate and consistent assessment of the state of water quality and how it changes over time as a national picture.  These assessments are made for Biological, Chemical and Nutrients and undertaken for discrete river stretches.The Chemistry GQAHI scheme has over 3000 sampling sites which provide information for approximately 22500 km of watercourses. In Wales we maintained the full GQA network based on 800 sampling sites which provides information for approximately 4700km.  Chemistry GQAHI/GQA sites are sampled twelve times a year, the samples being taken at the same spot on each sampling occasion to ensure consistency.  In England each chemical sample is measured for ammonia and dissolved oxygen. In Wales each chemical sample is measured for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia and dissolved oxygen (the most common types of organic pollution from sewage treatment works, agriculture and industry).  A category is assigned using three years worth of samples for each sampled chemical and assigned a category assessed against chemical standards expressed as percentiles The data collected over three years are used to determine average nutrient concentrations. So the classification for the year 2008 includes the results for 2006 and 2007.  Subsequently a category is assigned to each length of river according to the lowest standard achieved by any of the two or three measurements:The Chemistry GQA as used in Wales describes quality in terms of three chemical measurements that detect the most common types of organic pollution from sewage treatment works, agriculture and industry.

Grades were allocated for both phosphate and nitrate; they were not combined into a single nutrients grade. There were no set ‘good’ or ‘bad’ concentrations for nutrients in rivers in the way that we describe chemical and biological quality.

This species is widespread in Europe, but has declined since the 1940s. In the UK, GCN are widespread and locally common, with a patchy distribution, especially in South West England, parts of Wales, and in Scotland. A requirement of the Habitats Directive of each EU member state is to ensure that European Protected Species are maintained at or restored to ‘favourable conservation status’ across their natural range. In order to better understand the conservation status of the species in England, a much better understanding is needed of the distribution and extent of the population of the species in its natural range, and the habitat available to it. This project forms part of a series of projects to produce an enhanced evidence base which can be used to inform decisions about land-use planning and determining conservation status. It is the first of a two-stage exercise to collect data to develop a model for predicting the presence of GCN. Potential applications of a predictive model could include earlier identification of areas where GCN can be ruled in or out as a concern in land-use planning decisions.

The first process produced the ‘GIBC 01 - Typology & Functionality OS’ dataset. This dataset is then subsequently used as a  basis for the production of the second, third and fourth datasets during the second stage.In the first stage each OS polygon was assigned a green infrastructure category based on the SPADES project from the list below.  Green Infrastructure Categories are:• Garden• Green corridor• Pocket park• Park or garden• Outdoor sports facility• Children’s play space• Youth area• Broadleaved woodland• Mixed woodland• Coniferous woodland• Natural and semi-natural open spaces• Pasture or meadow• Wetland• Watercourse• Fresh water body• Allotments• Orchard• Cemetery or churchyard• Open space around premises• Agricultural land• Road island/verge• Railway corridor• Abandoned, ruderal and derelict areaThe OS polygon was then assigned “A function beneficial to people” dependent on the Green Infrastructure Category already assigned. The 26 categories that perform a “function beneficial to people” are: • Accessible water storage • Carbon storage • Community cohesion • Connection with local environment • Corridor for wildlife • Culture • Encouraging green travel • Evaporative cooling • Flow reduction through surface roughness • Habitat for wildlife • Heritage • Inaccessible water storage • Learning • Local food production • Pollination • Pollutant removal from soil/water • Providing jobs • Recreation - private • Recreation - public • Recreation - public with restrictions • Shading from the sun • Trapping air pollutants • Visual contribution to landscape character • Water conveyance • Water infiltration • Water interception In its simplest form the process flow looks like this: • OS base layer ? assigned green infrastructure ? assigned function(Eg - OS polygon ? coniferous woodland ? shading from the sun)The first dataset, ‘GIBC 01 - Typology & Functionality OS’, therefore shows the following:• The green infrastructure category• The function beneficial to people• Shows areas of greatest need for this function.• Shows areas whereby the function has been met.• Shows areas whereby the function has not been met.Second Stage ProcessingThe second stage expands on the first by establishing which areas suffer from stress associated with investment in growth and redevelopment of land. These areas are known as ‘pinch points’. Wherever there is a high level of need for a particular function (identified in the first process), a potential ‘pinch point’ exists. The pinch point categories that have been identified are:• Air Quality Pinch• Culture Pinch• Flooding Pinch• Heat Stress Pinch• Heritage Pinch• Local Community Pinch• Mental Health Pinch• Nature Pinch• Physical Activity Pinch• Recreation Pinch• Sustainable Travel PinchThe second dataset, ‘GIBC 02 – Pinch Points OS’, takes the analysis from the first stage process and using the Ordnance Survey data as a base layer, displays the ‘pinch points’ analysis results. The third dataset, ‘GIBC 03 – Pinch Points Consortium Housing’, takes the analysis from the first stage process and rather than using the OS as a base uses the Consortium Housing Site data instead to display ‘pinch points’.The fourth dataset, ‘GIBC 04 – Pinch Points Housing Land Availability’, takes the analysis from the first stage process and rather than using the OS as a base used the Strategic Housing Land Availability data instead to display ‘pinch points’.ConclusionThe ‘pinch point’ mapping can help identify particular areas of stress, which when used in conjunction with the green infrastructure and function mapping from the first stage process can be used to help alleviate those stresses.",Please see green infrastructure mapping method document and pinch points mapping explanation document,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,,,,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is termed the ‘Primary habitat’ e.g. lowland heathland.  The main baseline data used for this is the Priority Habitat Inventories (PHIv2.2). • The location of additional habitat that naturally form mosaics with the primary habitat e.g. habitats that are most likely to form ecological mosaics possibly used by species associated with the primary habitat.  This is termed the ‘Associated habitat’. The main baseline data used for this is the Priority Habitat Inventories (PHIv2.2). • The locations where habitat creation or restoration is known to occur, this is primarily sites under relevant agri-environment options.  This is termed the ‘Habitat creation’ • Sites where data suggests small fragments of the primary habitat or degraded habitat exists and where restoration may be possible, this is primarily developed from information held within the current PHI v2.2. This is termed the ‘Restorable habitat’.   Network Zones; • Land within close proximity to the existing habitat components that are more likely to be suitable for habitat re-creation for the particular habitat.  These areas are primarily based on soils but in many cases has been refined by also using other data such as hydrology, altitude and proximity to the coast. This is termed the ‘Network Enhancement Zone 1’. • Land within close proximity to the existing habitat components that are unlikely to be suitable for habitat re-creation but where other types of habitat may be created or land management may be enhanced including delivery of suitable Green Infrastructure. This is termed the ‘Network Enhancement Zone 2’. • Land immediately adjoining existing habitat patches that are small or have excessive edge to area ratio where habitat creation is likely to help reduce the effects of habitat fragmentation.  This is termed the ‘Fragmentation Action Zone’. • Land within relatively close proximity to  the Network Enhancement Zones 1 &amp; 2 that are more likely to be suitable for habitat creation for the particular habitat and identifying possible locations for connecting and linking up networks across a landscape.  This is termed the ‘Network Expansion Zone’.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Note:  For some habitat networks not all of the habitat components or all the action zones are identified either because the data does not exist or the habitat does not lend itself to identifying particular types of action.  Further details are outlined in the Habitat Network Mapping Guidance document. The Network boundary is drawn around the 4 habitat components using a variable buffering process with a generalised distance of 500m although 1km was used for Blanket Bog.  As the boundary for each habitat network is tightly drawn around the existing patches of habitat this means that at a national scale the habitat network is composed of a series of smaller ‘networks’ that encapsulates one or more clusters of existing habitat patches. These may be considered as ‘network segments’. The Network Expansion Zone has been drawn around these segments to identify areas where additional action may be undertaken to build greater ecological resilience across the wider landscape.","Created using the following data sets                   Priority Habitats’ Inventory V2.2 (PHI) for England - NE Soilscapes taken from NatMap Vector - NSRI/Cranfield University Urban Settlements - The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (ODPM) Terrain 50 OS - OS Mean High Water - England taken from OS Mastermap - OS Ancient Woodland Inventory (England) - NE Woodpasture &amp; Parkland Habitat Inventory (England) - NE Floodzone 3 - EA The data layers listed above were geoprocessed using FME to prepare a series of individual habitat network maps that have also been combined to produce 3 grouped habitat network maps.

The Skomer surveys were mainly a reconnaissance of the area whilst at Grassholm and Martins Haven, systematic surveys of the abundance of species in different habitats were carried out. The sites studied were subject to widely different regimes of exposure to water movement and included steep cliffs often extending into deep water, broken rock slopes, boulders and a variety of mixed sediments. A total of twenty-one sites were surveyed and the survey results are presented as an annotated list of 89 plant and 201 animal species with a description of each site, and summary of the communities present in different habitats. The survey results for Skomer and Martins Haven have been compared with the descriptions of the nine sublittoral habitats and communities defined for the whole coast of the area by Hunnam (1976). Although there are many similarities in the two sets of data, several of the habitats described here were either not encountered by Hunnam or their individual characteristics were lost in the generalised description of communities within a small number of habitat categories. The area described here included a wide variety of habitats and communities compared to most other locations of similar area in south-west Britain. Several locations were identified as of scientific interest. In addition, several species normally confined to the south or west coasts of the British Isles and abundant around Lundy were recorded but in very small amounts. It is recommended that future work related to conservation interests in the area should include studies of the west coast of Grassholm and The Smalls, and detailed descriptions of habitats and communities at key sites already identified in the region of Skomer.

Parallel surveys of the soft substrata and sublittoral hard substrata have also been conducted. The work was carried out during the summer of 1982 and subsequently supplemented by visits to less fully recorded sites. The purpose of this survey is to provide a topographical and biological description of the Anglesey and Arfon sides of the Menai Strait, concentrating on the hard or stable substrata and the animals and plants which live in these habitats. Flora and fauna lists are appended which cover all substrata. They are derived mainly from records in UCNW, Bangor, including those at the Marine Science Laborities, the School of Animal Biology and the School of Plant Biology. Additional records are from published material or personal information. Hard substrata have been studied rather longer than the soft, and littoral recording has been going on for longer than sublittoral work, but it has been highly selective; some areas of the Strait have been the subject of collecting and recording for many years; others have seldom been visited. This implies a judgement on the relative richness and interest and, in general, this difference in relative richness and interest is borne out by the observations of the present survey which may be summarised as follows: 1) The Menai Strait is an area of very unusual shores of great ecological interest. 2) This is because of a wide variety of rock types and other substrata and especially because these are subjected to strong tidal currents which are most rapid where wave action is minimal. This interest is not uniform, however, and some parts of the area stand out as particularly exciting: 1) Church Island and the adjacent shores, 2) Black Rock, 3) Puffin Island and Penmon, 4) Ynys y Moch and adjacent shores, 5) Gorad y Gyt to the Britainnia Bridge, 6) Llanddwyn, 7) Dinas Dinlle. Black Rock and Ynys y Moch are included in this list because of their past glories rather than their present depressed state. These shores make a particularly strong case for a policy of protection to prevent further damage by bait-digging. In the case of Ynys y Moch, some active restoration measures are also practicable but the recovery of shores like Black Rock will require a long period of peace. Llanddwyn and Dinas Dinlle are not high on the list because, though both include species not found elsewhere in the Strait, neither is particular rich by comparison with boulder or rocky shores farther along the north Wales coast. However, all these shores are of great interest and worthy of special efforts to conserve and protect. There are also stretches of the Strait where the littoral interest is not great. These must include the shores from Beaumaris to Ynys Gaint; Plas Newydd to Tal y Foel; Britainnia Bridge to Caenarvon. Further investigation is merited into possible reasons for absence or variations in flora and fauna on different sides of man-made structures in some isolated localities. There is no doubt that the Church Island region and whole of the Swillies shores between the bridges would merit NNR status in any assessment of British coasts. The inclusion of other parts of the Menai Strait must depend partly on the philosophy behind marine reserves. Thus the limits of Puffin Island to Llanddwyn/Dinas Dinlle define a clear geographical area and include, in the last two shores, typical (though not the richest) examples of certain habitats. The NE end of the Strait, however, is intrinsically more interesting than the SW and the Puffin Island, Black Rocks, Cae Coch and Penmon shores are worthy of inclusion on their own merits. This implies three possible limits: 1) The central reach, for which an overwhelming case exists, 2) The central and NE reaches, from Puffin Island to the Brittainnia Bridge, for which a strong case can be made on ecological grounds, 3) The whole of the Strait, for which the case tends to be more a matter of geographical unity. The historical aspect of conservation must also be considered. There are two main issues related to different time scales. In the longer scale, there are a series of structures used since the middle ages in a method of fishing, peculiar to the Menai Strait and surviving in various states of dilapidation. A major gap in our knowledge appears from this survey relating to these man-made structures and the activities of fishermen and other users of the waters in previous years. In the last 10 - 20 years, there has been an irreplaceable loss of local knowledge by the death of so many elderly people who had earned their living from the Straits. It is now probably too late to save more than a fraction of this once widespread knowledge, but an effort should certainly be made before the last remnants disappear. These Goradau should be made the subject of special conservation measures; one or more could be restored and used experimentally to establish the methods and efficiency of the fishery. Fundamental biological information would almost certainly be acquired at the same time. The most obvious Gorad on which to begin would be Gorad Bach near Beaumaris Life Boat House, which was the most recently used trap and where knowledge of the methods still survives. On a shorter time scale, extensive recording of animals and plants was carried out in the years 1887 - 1891 on Puffin Island, in other parts of the region in the next few years. This gives a picture of these shores at a point in time since when changes have occurred. We are approaching a hundred years since that surge of activity and another intensive recording period would produce very interesting comparisons and might be a very appropriate start to the management plan of a new reserve. In this connection it might be added that there are areas of potential interest which have never been adequately explored. These include Ynys Gorad Goch, the Brittainnia Rock, the Platters and Swilly rock; it is ironic that these are within the central area which possesses, in Church Island, the most intensively studied shores of all. In fact, the establishment of a Marine Nature Reserve in the Menai Strait is not merely an attempt to preserve a very well known stretch of coast - it can be a stimulus to more active investigation of a surprisingly incompletely explored area.

Surveys were carried out on two days. On October 10th 1982, 11 sites were surveyed in the region of Gateholm. On October 24th 1982, 3 sites were surveyed to the east of Martins Haven. Survey staff included biologists and divers recruited from the Pembrokeshire BS-AC Branch 417. Broad descriptions of habitats and communities were made based on the recording card developed for the South-West Britain Sublittoral Survey. Areas to the west and south of Gateholm were found to be predominantly rocky with some areas of sand. Rich plant and animal communities were observed, but it was not considered that any especially unusual communities or species were present. The sea bed to the north of Gateholm included extensive areas of sand but where rock was present, species characteristic of open-coast conditions were more common than to the south. Areas to the east of Martins Haven were remarkably similar in the habitats and communities present. Here, the bedrock and boulder slope with fringing areas of small boulders, stones and shells, extended only about 30 m from the shore and to depths of about 14 m. Offshore, there was plain of muddy sand charaterised by a fairly epifaunal community. Some alterations to the habitats mapped by P. Hunnam in 1976 were made and it was also found difficult to match descriptions from the present work to the small number of categories included on the 1976 map. It was concluded that the absence of any sublittoral habitats or communities of outstanding interest south of Gateholm would allow the termination of the reserve boundary at the western point of Gateholm and that, to include the areas of offshore rocky sea bed, there could usefully be a straight-line boundary from Gateholm Point to 500 m south of the Mew Stone. On the northern coast, it was suggested that, providing the boundary extended at least as far east as High Point, there were no biological grounds for precisely determining its eastern extent beyond that. The presence of very extensive areas of muddy sand with similar communities from about 40 m offshore provoked questioning of the offshore extent of the reserve boundary which could be as little as 200 m to include the main communities of conservation interest. However, practical points of navigation and enforcement would be important considerations and no recommendations have been made. It was also pointed out that a straight-line boundary from 500 m north of the Garland Stone towards the east would be practical.

The estuary is approximately 10km in length and between 1 and 2 km in width at the high water mark. Most of this area dries at low water leaving a channel of less than 500m at its widest point. The estuary is sheltered from prevailing winds and wave action to a large extent by Dawlish Warren, an unusual double spit which has been formed across the mouth of the estuary. This feature, together with an area of shoaling sand called Pole Sand, restricts the sea opening of the estuary to a long narrow channel. Currents are rapid as a consequence of river and tidal flow being restricted to a narrow channel for much of the tidal cycle. In addition, salinity is reduced over most of the estuary, particularly at low water after significant rainfall. On these occasions, the water at Topsham may almost be fresh. Benthic habitats are sedimentary in nature with extensive mud and sand flats intertidally. Patches of saltmarsh and swards of Zostera spp. occur in the muddier reaches. There are no rocky shores within the estuary and what little alternative hard substrata there is consist of stones and small boulders concentrated around the high water mark. Stone-faced railway embankments down either side of the estuary occasionally fall within the upper intertidal zone. Subtidally, habitats are also predominantly sedimentary, ranging from sand, stones and boulders at the mouth to mud at the head. Outcrops of flat bedrock occur in the narrow channel entrance. Outside the main estuary basin, rocky shores occur east of Exmouth at Maer Rocks, and at Orcombe point and beyond. There is little commercial fishing within the estuary, apart from netting for salmon, trout and eels. Shellfish, mainly oysters but also including some mussels and manilla clams, are also grown-on at sites within the estuary. The area is used intensively for recreation, including most watersports, and the sandy beaches on the open coast are popular with tourist. In addition many visitors are attracted specifically by the overwintering populations of waders and wildfowl for which the Exe is of international importance. The area has long been of scientific interest, both biologically and physiographically, and is currently used for both educational and research purposes.The geological, ornithological and marine biological importance of the estuary is well recognised and is detailed in the notification of both Dawlish Warren, and the rest of the estuary, as SSSI,s. In addition, Dawlish Warren is a Local Nature Reserve and the western half of the estuary from Dawlish Warren up to Turf has been designated a wild bird sanctuary. The present survey, carried out in August 1985, aimed to collect information on the variety of intertidal and subtidal habitats and communities present. The last descriptive marine biological survey covering the whole estuary took place in 1901. In order to determine what changes, if any, had taken place since that time, many of the old sample sites were re-visited. A total of 47 sites were sampled, of which 34 were intertidal and 13 were subtidal. At each intertidal site the abundance of epiflora, epifauna and conspicuous infaunal species was recorded in situ. Sediment cores were taken and sieved over a 0.1mm mesh to obtain samples of the macrofauna. Subtidal areas were sampled using a combination of trawling, pipe-dredging and diving. During the survey, a total of five intertidal and four subtidal habitats were distinguished. Epifaunal and algal diversity was generally low due to the scarcity of stable hard substrata. However the infauna was richer and was typically estuarine in nature with dense populations of species such as Nereis diversicolor, Scrobicularia plana and Lanice conchilega to be found locally. Diversity tended to be higher in the heterogenous muddy sand areas of the middle and lower reaches of the estuary. Further north, sediments were of uniform mud and were influenced by reduced or fluctuating salinities. Around the estuary mouth, faunal populations in the tidally swept clean sands were often comparitively sparse, but notable for including the polychaete Ophelia bicornis which has attracted much scientific study since the 1940's. The main characteristics of the communities found do not appear to have changed significantly since the turn of the century. However, in contrast to previous records, neither Nucella lapilus or Sabellaria alveolata were found during the present survey. The former species appears to have declined dramatically in southwest Britain recently, and organotin compounds in antifouling paint are suspected as a possible cause. The latter species has been shown to fluctuate widely in abundance at any one site, and it is possible that trampling pressure plays a part in such variation. Alien species are also present including Sargassum muticum on rocky shores just outside the main estuary. The scientific interest and nature conservation importance of the area has been assessed using standard criteria and the conservation importance of the habitat and communities in the area have been provisionally graded as of Local, Regional, National and International importance. Species of particular scientific interest identified during survey work have also been noted and their conservation importance provisionally graded as of Regional, National or International importance. The Exe estuary is considered to be of high scientific interest for its populations of Ophelia bicornis and because it supports infaunal communities that are representative of their type in southwest Britain. This is in addition to the well recognised importance of the area for estuarine birds. Furthermore, such scientific study has been, and still is, carried out here alongside its continuing use for educational purposes. Potential threats to these interest are all associated with the recreational usage of the estuary which is already high. These include the proposals to build marina facilities, the effects of organotin antifouling compounds and bait digging.

Samples were obtained in cores taken along a 50m transect line stretched out across the seabed from the edge of the cages. At two of the sites, fish cages had been operating for approximately 15 months whilst the third site had only been subjected to fish farm inputs for 4 months. At one of the older cage sites, situated in a very sheltered voe, the muddy sediments supported a low diversity community of which the main components were Capitella capitata and unidentified nematodes. Although apparently stressed, no gradients in community structure attributable to fish farm inputs were discernable. This may have been due to the transect line used not being long enough to include the whole of the gradient from polluted to clean conditions, because diver observations certainly suggested the existence of farm input-related gradients in other more readily visible parameters. At the other two sites, sediments were coarser and more mixed although the seabed at one of these was clearly more exposed to tidal currents than the other. They both supported a diverse infauna; that from the more exposed site numerically dominated by Corophium crassicorne, and that from the more sheltered site by Capitomastus minimus and unidentified oligachaetes. At the more exposed (and most recent) of these sites, the infauna within approximately 5m of the cages had been modified by fish farm inputs, and consisted predominantly of dense populations of Capitella capitata.

At present, thirty outfalls discharge crude sewage into the lower River Bure, causing some organic enrichment to the lower River Bure. The survey was carried out in the first week in June 1987. Eight sites were sampled with a cylindrical corer (15cms diam by 20cms deep). Three replicates were taken from the mid horizontal distance point between high and low tides. Cores were taken soon after low water on each occassion. A sub sample from each sample was taken for sediment analysis, the remainder was sieved through a 500 micron sieve. The survey suggests sewage enrichment of the lower estuary increases the productivity but does not adversely affect the species diversity. It was also postulated that much of the mercury discharged through the Norwich sewage works during the previous twenty years has accumulated in the sediments of Breydon Water. The estuary was found to support a healthy, but undiverse invertebrate fauna. The lack of diversity was thought to be due to the homogeneity of the sediment types and the lack of extremes of salinity within Breydon Water.

The `Y'-shaped loch system, comprising Lochs a' Chairn Bhain, Glencoul, Glendhu, Beag and Shark, is 15 km long and reaches maximum depths of 111 m in the deepest of its six basins. The relatively complex series of basins and sills categorize the system as a type `C' (Milne 1972), and result in the absence of the seasonal fjordic loch stagnation of deep water shown by other fjordic lochs. The system is steep-sided, with a relatively small littoral area, bedrock and boulders extending through the littoral and into the circalittoral in almost all areas. Sediment predominates in the middle of the loch. The sediment composition depends heavily upon the level of exposure to water movement with coarse, clean sediments in Eddrachillis Bay grading to fine soft muds in the deep water basins and at the loch heads. The sequence of sediments is interupted in the narrows region at Kylesku and on the sills, where increased current speed results in the presence of coarser sediments. The area in which the loch lies is fairly remote, with little habitation and no shore-based industry. Major uses of the loch are scampi fishing, by trawl and creel, and fish farming. The number of leased fish farm sites is currently at least 12, not all of which were occupied by fish farms at the time of the survey. Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest border on Loch Cairnbawn, one at the head of Loch Glencoul, and the other along most of the southern shore of Loch a'Chairn Bhain. Very few marine biological studies have been carried out in the loch, these being limited to some littoral recording and some grab sampling of sublittoral sediments. The present survey, carried out in October 1988, aimed to describe the marine habitats and communities present in the loch and to assess their nature conservation importance. A total of 40 sites were visited, of which 4 were littoral and 36 were sublittoral. At each site the abundance of the epiflora and fauna was recorded and the habitats described. No infaunal sampling was carried out. Thirty two sublittoral and three littoral habitat types were identified, and these are described in this report. A list of the taxa recorded is also given. The communities present in Eddrachillis Bay were open coast in nature, and there was a transition to sheltered sea loch communities further into the system. The narrows area in the middle of the loch an exception to the gradual transition, with the presence of a range of high energy habitats due to the accelerated tidal streams in this region, and was one of the more interesting features of the system. The scientific interest and conservation importance of the area have been assessed using standard criteria. These have been applied to each of the habitats or community types identified which have been provisionally graded as of Local, Regional, National or International importance. Species of particular scientific and conservation interest have been provisionally graded as of provisional Regional or National importance. Loch Cairnbawn appears to contain a good range of the habitats and community types typical of sheltered, fjordic sea lochs, with no particularly unique features.

The first two are connected by the East Kyle of Bute, a shallow channel running between Bute and the mainland. Loch Long is the largest fjordic loch in the group; Loch Striven has some similarities to Loch Long and is the second largest. Loch Goil forms a north-west trending branch of Loch Long, separated from the main body of the loch by a shallow sill. The latter three lochs all have a small percentage of intertidal to total area. The Gareloch is relatively shallow without subtidal rocky features, but does have a sill towards the mouth. The main feature of Loch Riddon is the Ruel Estuary, which has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The entrance into the East Kyle from Loch Riddon is via the shallower tide-swept narrows around the Burnt Islands; the area experiences the strongest current surveyed in the north Clyde sealochs. The Holyloch has no sill/basin features, the seabed sloping gradually out to deeper water in the Firth of Clyde. Like the Gareloch, it has a paucity of sublittoral bedrock. The whole area has been affected by sewage pollution with some improvement over the last 25 years, but the effects are still noticeable in the Gareloch and Holyloch. There is a strong Naval presence throughout the lochs with large submarine bases in the Holyloch and Gareloch. Twenty-one littoral and 82 sublittoral sites were surveyed, from which 27 habitat or community types were described. A list of the taxa recorded is also given. All the lochs in this system were characterized by sheltered communities. Only a few shores had communities typical of moderately exposed conditions, dominated by barnacles, the majority being fucoid-dominated and giving way to Laminaria saccharina forests in the infralittoral. Algal diversity in the infralittoral was low throughout the lochs, grazing echinoderms and chitons leaving large areas of denuded rock with abundant encrusting coralline algae. Steeply sloping bedrock in the circalittoral supporting a Protanthea simplex/Neocrania anomala community with Sabella pavonina and Ciona intestinalis. On most sites, however, bedrock and boulder slopes finished around the limit of the lower infralittoral/upper circalittoral and were replaced by shelly and sandy mixed sediment slopes with mud, finally leading onto mud plains in the deeper areas of the lochs. Scavenging mobile species, including hermit crabs, gobies and dragonets plus sediment-burrowing anemones Cerianthus lloydii, slender seapens Virgularia mirabilis, burrowing and tube-forming polychaetes and burrowing bivalve molluscs were found on these mixed sediments. Deeper mud, well worked by crustaceans including the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus and the echiuran Maxmuelleria lankesteri was found in most of the lochs, other areas having beds of burrowing brittlestars, Amphiura spp. The large cerianthid anemone Pachycerianthus multiplicatus was also found in muddy sediments. Tidal streams affected sediment grading in the East Kyle. Here coarser and sandier sediments supported beds of brittlestars Ophiothrix fragilis and Ophiocomina nigra and the infauna included the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum and the burrowing holothurian Labidoplax digitata. Two rare species were found in Loch Goil; the holothurian Ocnus planci and the tunicate Styela gelatinosa.

The details of this work is described in a previous report to the NCC, which also describes the general marine flora and fauna of the trails and adjacent areas. The numbered stations along the trails were originally intended to provide convenient points for description in diver guides. However, their permanence makes them ideal long-term monitoring stations. This study aimed to give a detailed description of each of the 9 stations along the primary trail. This includes habitat descriptions, species lists and diagrams. Additionally a set of slides for each station has been prepared with wide angle views (2 m across), closer views (60 cm across) and detailed shots (24 cm across). Underwater video footage has also been recorded and used in preparing the description of the stations.",This survey was extracted from a Marine Recorder snapshot.,Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a limited range of habitats from the hard substrata sites which, together with the isolated nature of the sites within the region and the heavy sediment influence in most habitats, has lead to a poor species diversity.

This is present as a result of being emitted by plants further up the Plym. It covers large areas, usually deposited in layers or bands, and restricts the mobility of the sediment macrofauna to the extent of it being near unhabitable. Certain common estuarine species such as Corophium volutator appear to be unusually low in number. This observation is suggested to be a reason for the poor bird population found around the estuary. Species such as Hediste diversicolor and Carcinus maenas however are found in high numbers. It is recommended that the China Clay deposits in the estuary are mapped and studied in full.

This dataset includes the collation of aerial imagery for 44 sites around the Welsh coastline, selected to contain rocky shore, saltmarsh or Sabellaria alveolata across temporal scales providing suitable data for comparisons of change through time, both anthropogenic and biological. In order for comparisons to present day imagery, current aerial imagery was also obtained in this study. Photographic aerial images containing features of conservation value (specifically rocky shores, Sabellaria alveolata inhabited shores and saltmarsh areas) within Wales were obtained. Historic photographic aerial images that contained features of conservation value (specifically rocky shores, Sabellaria alveolata inhabited shores and saltmarsh areas) within Wales were selected from expert knowledge and Countryside Council for Wales's collection of habitat maps. The aim of this project was to collate, digitise and georeference aerial photographic imagery for sites that had multi-year overlap. Accuracies of less than 5 m RMS was obtained (with the exception of Treath Lafan, 1995, and the Dyfi Estuary, 1975). At these saltmarsh locations, there were too few ground control points to achieve this accuracy.","Rocky shores sites included Bull Bay, Cemlyn Bay, Cemaes Bay, Holyhead, Penrhyn (East side of Holyhead bay) and Trearddur Bay. Sabellaria sites included Aberaeron, Mochras and Llanddulas and S. alveolata. Those images remaining as photographic prints were digitised using an Epson GT-15000 scanner at 1200 dots per inch (dpi). Images in adjacent locations were mosaicked with the image panorama generating software Autopano Giga 2.6, with a root mean square error (RMS) of less than 5 m where possible. Aerial images were then georeferenced in ArcMap10.0, using Ordnance Survey maps where features were readily visible both on the map and on the image. On occasion, images were georeferenced using aerial imagery that was already georeferenced. Accuracies of less than 5 m RMS was obtained. Georeferenced images were then rectified with the ArcMap10 Nearest Neighbour (for discrete data) function as uncompressed TIFFs, before compression to JPEG format with 100% image quality. Image clarity and descriptions were given for individual images. Spatial reference for all data is British National Grid. Present-day low-altitude imagery was captured with a time-lapse compact Canon camera (D10) with no flash and infinity focus. The camera was attached to either a kite or a helium balloon and led over the sites of interest. The resultant images were mosaicked with Autopano Giga 2.6 achieving the lowest RMS possible and visual clarity. Ground control points were marked during the aerial fly over with a dGPS (Leica GS50 or Magellan MobileMapper 6). On several occasions, dominant habitat types were also walked round in the field providing habitat ground-truthing, logging polylines in the GPS systems. The data from the GPS systems were post-processed using ephemeris data from a fixed station (Morpeth), to achieve accuracies of less than 1.5 m for ground control points and less than 3 m for walk-around data.",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Site Units are divisions of SSSIs. based on habitat, tenure and management, and are the basis for recording all information on SSSI Condition and management. They range in Area from 0.004ha up to 18,000ha and only overlap where SSSIs overlap. Boundaries are generally mapped against Ordnance Survey MasterMap.  The decline in ‘Favourable’ condition area between 31st March 2010 and 31st March 2011 resulted from a more rigorous application of ‘Common Standards for Monitoring’ in the run up to the 2010 end of year PSA target deadline, see Further Information table which accompanies this metadata. SSSI Units are periodically revised - internal boundary reunitisation and positional accuracy imorovement will result in changes in the geography.

A CPA consent was required for an activity to take place which may be detrimental to the safety of navigation.,"Prior to 6th April 2011, CPA consents and licences under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 were issued through a legacy Marine Consents Management System (MCMS). The legacy MCMS database contains information associated with each licence or consent issued, including the geographical extent in the form of coordinates. A number of known issues within the database prevented the data being converted into a meaningful and accurate GIS dataset.  In 2012 the MMO commissioned a project to extract and correct the spatial information relating to legacy MCMS licences and consents. The project identified a number of issues in the spatial data, it recorded the errors and corrected them where possible. The result is a series of spatial datasets giving the spatial extent of Marine Licences and Marine Consents prior to April 2011.  You can access the report for the MMO1025 Legacy Licensing Data project by contacting the MMO Access to Information team and ing the ISBN reference 978-1-909452-06-0.  The project identified a number of issues with the data and flagged each record with an error code. The error codes are presented in the associated report identified above. A large proportion of the errors were resolved or improved using automated correctional methods in GIS, however some errors were unable to be corrected without referring back to the original case files. Any records that contain an error that has not been fixed have been removed from this dataset until such a time when it can be resolved to a satisfactory standard. Records with the following error codes have been removed until further notice, ?GRI?, ?U&amp;#x2F;NP?or ?X?.  There is potential for duplication between records in the consent and license datasets due to the regulatory process at the time of application.  Some of the licences or consents issued through the legacy MCMS database may have been transferred to the current MCMS database, or a variation has since been issued which may have been processed using the current system. Therefore there is potential for duplication of records between this dataset and the current MCMS database",Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both datasets are statutory Instruments and together they provide different classifications of land in England based on the difficulty of farming. Less Favoured Areas are a transposed European Commission designation which provides special measures to assist farming in the areas designated. The Less Favoured Areas consist of Severely Disadvantaged and Disadvantaged Areas. They are (mainly upland) areas where the natural characteristics (geology, altitude, climate, etc.) make economic competition difficult. In place since 1975, it is a long standing measure of the Common Agricultural Policy. The Moorland Line is a further designation of land within the LFA, and it is also used under domestic legislation to better target support for the uplands. The Moorland Line encloses land within England which has been defined as predominantly semi-natural upland vegetation, or predominantly of rock outcrops and semi-natural vegetation, used primarily for rough grazing. It was drawn up in 1992 to assist the development, implementation and evaluation of policy in the English Uplands. The moorland line encloses some 42% of LFA land. The 5 regions in the Less Favoured Areas and Moorland Lines dataset are classified as:     • N: Land outside Severely Disadvantaged Area (lowland)     • S: Land within Severely Disadvantaged Area (upland)     • D: Land within Disadvantaged Area     • MS: Moorland within a Severely Disadvantaged Area     • MD: Moorland within Disadvantaged Area","The LFA boundaries were hand digitised at 1:25,000 scale based on physical boundaries and on Ordnance Survey MasterMap boundaries.

Captured by various independent surveyors, a ground truth survey is a collection of a few hundred points captured on a flat, unambiguous surface such as a tarmac car park or tennis court using GPS. Each ground truth point has an accuracy of +/-3cm R.M.S.E and contains attribute information such as the date of survey, surface type, survey method and transformation and geoidal models used. A ground truth survey may potentially be used for multiple LIDAR surveys provided it is less than 5 years old, or 3 years for coastal projects. The LIDAR timestamped survey is compared against the ground truth survey to assess the Root Mean Square Error (R.M.S.E), standard deviation and random error of the LIDAR. All LIDAR surveys must report an error of less than +/-15cm RMSE and 10cm for standard deviation and random error to pass quality control. For the specific ground truth results for a LIDAR survey please contact us.","The Environment Agency LIDAR Ground Truth Archive is an archive of X,Y,Z points and attribute information that have been independently surveyed to verify the accuracy of the EA's LIDAR Timestamped surveys. Captured by various independent surveyors, a ground truth survey is a collection of a few hundred points captured on a flat, unambiguous surface such as a tarmac car park or tennis court using GPS. Each ground truth point has an accuracy of .+/-3cm R.M.S.E and contains attribute information such as the date of survey, surface type and survey method. A ground truth survey may be used for multiple LIDAR surveys provided it is less that 5 years old, or 3 years for coastal projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Environment Agency has been capturing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data regularly since 1998. We currently have over 10,000 discrete individual surveys, each ranging in coverage from a few square kilometres to hundreds of square kilometres. We use aerial LIDAR, an airborne mapping technique, which accurately measures the height of the terrain and surface objects on the ground, through the use of a scanning laser that measures the distance between the aircraft and the ground. Tens to hundreds of thousands of measurements per second are made of the ground, allowing highly detailed terrain models to be generated at spatial resolutions of between 25cm and 2 metres. Accurate elevation data is available for over 72% of England.  The laser returns received are presented as 3-dimensional point cloud data in LAZ format. Each laser point contains additional information where available like intensity, classification and return. LIDAR point data is available for most surveys carried out since 2005 as simple XYZ points. Point data with intensity is available for most surveys from 2007. All return point data is available for most surveys from 2009 onwards.  The data are presented as tiles in British National Grid OSGB 1936 projections. Historic data are available for some areas where we have carried out repeat surveys.","Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is an airborne mapping technique, which uses a laser to measure the distance between the aircraft and the ground.

These habitats are threatened due to their removal for use in gardens and water features. Many limestone pavements have been designated as SSSIs which affords them some protection.

The project uses a machine learning approach to image classification, developed under the Defra Living Maps project (SD1705 – Kilcoyne et al., 2017). The method first clusters homogeneous areas of habitat into segments, then assigns each segment to a defined list of habitat classes using Random Forest (a machine learning algorithm). The habitat probability map displays modelled likely broad habitat classifications, trained on field surveys and earth observation data from 2021 as well as historic data layers. This map is an output from Phase IV of the Living England project, with future work in Phase V (2022-23) intending to standardise the methodology and Phase VI (2023-24) to implement the agreed standardised methods. The Living England habitat probability map will provide high-accuracy, spatially consistent data for a range of Defra policy delivery needs (e.g. 25YEP indicators and Environment Bill target reporting Natural capital accounting, Nature Strategy, ELM) as well as external users. As a probability map, it allows the extrapolation of data to areas that we do not have data. These data will also support better local and national decision making, policy development and evaluation, especially in areas where other forms of evidence are unavailable.

This species is commercially valuable and has been targeted by fisheries for over a century; however, fisheries in Wales and beyond have seen a steep decline in landings since the 1960s which coincided with the introduction of net fisheries for this species. The crawfish is a priority species for the UK Biodiversity Action Plan and is also an important component of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) designated for rocky reefs. It has been identified by the National Assembly for Wales as one of the species of 'principle importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity' in Wales and is listed in the Natural Environment Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006. This act requires that steps be taken that are 'reasonably practicable to further the conservation of the living organisms' listed and to 'promote the taking by others of such steps'. It is therefore important to understand the potential impact of fisheries management measures and other management measures on the recovery of this species both in designated areas and within the wider context of Welsh waters as a whole including the potential impact of regulations or management measures in adjacent waters. The purpose of this data capture was to investigate management measures for the self-propagated future recovery of crawfish Palinurus elephas in Welsh waters. The overall aim of this survey and reporting work was to establish the potential effectiveness of existing and possible management measures (both fishery and nature conservation based) to enable self-propagated recovery of P. elephas populations in Welsh waters within the context of their declined status. This was to be carried out through a review of relevant literature on this and other crustacean species to determine using the best available data and information the potential benefit of the different management measures.","In order to assess the potential effectiveness of existing and potential management measures for the recovery of Welsh populations of P elephas a review of available information has been carried out in the form of a literature review, including grey literature, and through liaison with persons with specific relevant expertise. Where possible direct examples of recovery attributed to different management measures are reported including timescales. Where direct examples are not available, comparisons are drawn and aspects of the biology of P. elephas are interpreted with regards to the specific management measure in question. Where relevant management measures are applied in adjacent areas with the potential to aid recovery in Welsh waters, these are also included. The limitations of each management measure in aiding the potential recovery of crawfish populations in Welsh waters are also discussed.

There are two datasets available for download: 'Marine Habitats and Species Open Data' and 'Marine Designated Site Features Open Data'. The dataset 'Marine Habitats Species Open Data' comprises eight sub-datasets: three point datasets and five polygonal. These represent all publicly available datasets of marine habitats and species held by Natural England. The dataset 'Marine Designated Site Features Open Data' is a subset of the habitat and species data, which shows habitats and species (feature) data only within the site in which they are legally designated.

Additionally, 'Marine Designated Site Features Open Data' is provided with an ESRI structured layer file (LYR). All dataset geometry has been validated using the ESRI validation method. It has not been validated using the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) validation method and therefore may not comply with the OGC specification. These datasets are available under the Open Government Licence (OGL).","This dataset contains records that qualify as open and therefore can be published under the Open Government Licence (OGL).

This extraction is based on the dataset identifier, access limitations and data owner as defined within the Marine Metadatabase to ensure that only open datasets are included in the open version. Point data is added cumulatively to the evidence base; polygonal data is 'stacked' using the MESH confidence score to ensure that only one polygonal record is present at any single location and that this record has the highest confidence score.

Marine_Scotland_FishDAC_856,6260,MEDIN Sample,Marine Scotland,"environment,biota,economy,inlandWaters,oceans,transportation,utilitiesCommunication",,Marine Scotland Reports - Marine Environment - Scotland's Marine Atlas,Scotland's Marine Atlas: Information for the national marine plan. Marine Scotland,"Scotland‚Äôs vision is for ‚Äòclean, healthy, safe, productive, biologically diverse marine and coastal environments, managed to meet the long term needs of nature and people‚Äô. This assessment of the condition of Scotland‚Äôs seas has been based on scientific evidence from data and analysis, supported by expert judgement.Climate Change and Ocean AcidificationThe climate shows considerable variation over short and long timescales. However, in recent years there has been a marked increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere of the Earth and, at the same time, sea surface temperature has risen as have sea levels. Changes in the biological components of the seas have been observed including earlier plankton blooms, a northward movement of some species and a reductionin seabird populations, all of which have been linked to climate change.At the same time, the seas are becoming more acidic, the consequences of which, especially for calcareous organisms, could be significant. Reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases are required and Scotland has set ambitious targets. However, even with such reductions, it is highly likely that further impacts of climate change on the marine environment will be observed.Clean and SafeScotland‚Äôs seas are mainly clean and safe, although there are some localised areas where there is contamination or hazards to human health. For example, sediments in several harbours and estuaries remain contaminated with hazardous substances, a legacy of past industrial discharges. Water quality in the Forth and Clyde estuaries is compromised by discharges of industrial effluent and treated sewage although effluent treatment hasimproved resulting in returning populations of residential and migratory fish. The use of historical contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and tributyl tin (TBT) has been banned, and monitoring continues to assess their continued environmental decline.Information is being gathered on a range of other contaminants, including endocrine disrupters and brominated flame retardants, to assess their environmental impacts. Diffuse inputs of nutrients and bacteria have given rise, respectively, to some localised issues in small east coast estuaries and at bathing beaches. Action plans have been put in place to tackle these issues. Concerns such as marine litter and underwater noise havebecome more broadly recognised and will be addressed through the operational response to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Generally the effects of noise remain unquantified and unknown.Healthy and Biologically DiverseScotland‚Äôs seas support a diverse array of habitats and species and contain nationally and internationally important populations of certain species such as the northern feather star, the burrowing sea anemone, the northern sea fan and cold water corals.There is evidence that certain habitats have been impacted, for example shallow and shelf subtidal sediments (including burrowed mud habitats). This stems largely from the effects of fishing over large areas of the seabed and more localised impacts from activities such as aquaculture.The low abundance of some demersal commercial fish species across the west coast of Scotland is a major concern and is being addressed through various initiatives. Improved knowledge of fishing activity and its impact on the marine environment would be beneficial.Establishment of new fisheries should only be undertaken following careful assessment of the viability and future sustainability of the fishery, especially given the sensitivity of some, particularly deep water, species to fishing and against a background of historic over-exploitation.Sharks, skates and rays face further declines and are severely depleted all around the coast, although the number of sightings of basking sharks has increased in recent years especially in the Minches and Malin Sea. These declines are largely the consequence of historically unsustainable catches in both target and non-target fisheries and their long-lived, very low fecundity life cycle. Many of these, for example, porbeagle andcommon skate, can no longer be targeted commercially.Populations of some seabirds, harbour seals and some fish species have declined. Possible reasons include climate change, a number of different human activities and competition from other species. These declines may be associated with broader changes in the food web. For example, the decline in availability of sandeels has had a major influence on recent changes in seabird numbers on the east coast and in the Northern Isles.Although, in general, the current assessment for cetaceans suggests there are no specific concerns, this has been made against a background of a very high level of uncertainty and little power to detect concerns if they currently exist.ProductiveScotland‚Äôs seas are economically productive. Official figures show that the core marine sector, less the extraction of oil and gas, contributed ¬£3.6 billion of Gross Value Added (GVA) in 2008 (at 2009 prices), about 3.5% of overall Scottish GVA. About 39,800 people were employed, 1.6% of Scottish employment. The extraction of oil and gas had a GVA of ¬£13.3 billion in 2007 (at 2009 prices). Fishing takes place in all Scottish sea areas but some, such as Hebrides, North Scotland Coast and East and West Shetland, are far more economically productive than others. Aquaculture, both finfish and shellfish, predominates on the west coast and the islands.Sixteen major ports handle about 98% of all port traffic with liquid bulk, mainly oil and gas, accounting for 69%. There is significant commercial shipping both to ports and for transit through Scottish waters, as well as domestic and international ferry activity. The seas are also used extensively by the Royal Navy and other armed forces, for exercises and operations, sometimes including international partners.Other activities include cooling water abstraction for power stations and the disposal of treated urban waste water, industrial effluent and dredge spoil. Seabed telecommunications cables carry millions of internet and phone call connections, thereby providing a major communications network.The seas are also used for leisure and recreation, particularly sailing, angling and other sporting activities. Scotland‚Äôs historic environment and natural and cultural heritage attract many tourists.The enormous potential of marine renewable energy generation from offshore wind, waves and tides has started to be harnessed. There is also potential for storage of carbon dioxide under the seabed, in ‚Äòcarbon capture and storage‚Äô schemes.Also see http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/345830/0115128.pdf for maps and further details.","Aim of Scotland‚Äôs Marine AtlasThe first ‚ÄòMarine Atlas‚Äô presents data spatially to assist with the introduction of marine planning. It does so based around the elements of the government‚Äôs vision for the sea: clean and safe, healthy and biologically diverse and productive.The Atlas presents the assessment of condition and summary of significant pressures and the impacts of humanactivity required for the national marine plan. It also represents a contribution to the initial assessment required for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD)(1) by July 2012.Area covered and scale of dataThe Marine (Scotland) Act 2010(2) and the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2 009(3) provide for marine planning of Scottish waters out to 200 nautical miles and give new marine conservation responsibilities. So this Atlas presents data over this whole area, including for policy areas which are reserved to Westminster, to ensure that policies developed in the national marine plan are informed by the fullest data possible. The Atlas refers to avariety of boundaries and spatial scales: ‚Ä¢ 200 nautical miles ‚Äì the maximum limit for fisheries and renewable energy powers. Marine planning and natureconservation powers can extend further.‚Ä¢ 12 nautical mile territorial sea ‚Äì limit of Scotland as defined in the Scotland Act.‚Ä¢ 3 nautical miles - the limit to which Water Framework Directive measures have been implemented in Scotland.Data can be aggregated to different scales for different purposes, so its presentation has to consider the purpose.This Atlas presents data at the most relevant scale available to illustrate the main issues for national marine planning. There is provision for future marine plans to be developed for Scottish marine regions. These regions have yet to be decided. However, the 15 sea areas used in this Atlas, based on areas previously adopted for certain environmental monitoring programmes, are likely to be of a similar scale as marine regions.The data from these 15 areas can be presented regionally and also reasonably aggregated to form a national picture and to develop information for the two main areas required for the MSFD initial assessment: the Greater North Sea (Area II) and the Celtic Seas (Area III) which are existing sea areas used by OSPAR (the Oslo Paris Convention for the Protection of the North East Atlantic)(4).How this Atlas has been compiledThe Atlas has taken Scotland‚Äôs Seas: Towards Understanding their State, published in 2008(5), and developed itscontents to provide a spatial assessment where possible. Much effort has been taken to map data sets and present graphs around them. It is recognised that there are some areas where this is not yet possible so the provision of spatial data suitable for marine planning will be an evolutionary process. A data annex available online, lists the various data sources used for this Atlas.The preparation of the Atlas has been a collaborative effort. Marine Scotland led the work on chapters 2, 5 and 6,with SEPA in the lead for chapter 3 and SNH, with assistance from JNCC, leading chapter 4. Each contributor also developed the appropriate part of the overall assessment. A valuable contribution was also provided by the Marine Alliance for Science and Technology Scotland (MASTS)(6) to all work. The Agri-Food &amp; Biosciences Institute; Centre for Environment, Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture Science; Countryside Council for Wales; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; Environment Agency; National Oceanography Centre; Natural England and Northern Ireland Environment Agency all reviewed Atlas material.A variety of data sources have been used. The key data sets are from the range of established monitoring programmes undertaken by the various contributing organisations for their main responsibilities, for example, to meet legal obligations. For much of the productive seas data, existing data from regularly published government statistics have been used. Most data have required some re-working to be presented at the level ofthe sea areas used.Data used for Charting Progress 2 (CP2)(7), published in July 2010, have also been heavily relied on here. CP2 was the second assessment of the UK seas and involved the same contributing Scottish scientists as this Atlas. This Atlas draws on the four CP2 Feeder Reports adding more detail where necessary and appropriate to mapScottish seas.To make the Atlas easily accessible and to focus on portraying information spatially, the material has been restricted to summaries and short text, complimented by images and graphs. For many topics, further information isavailable from a variety of sources and these are referenced.

Monitoring of physical parameters in the strait, including water turbidity, has been carried out on a sporadic basis for the past 40 years. These parameters are of importance to the biological communities for which the Menai Strait and Conwy Bay has been designated and help to inform assessments of the condition of those communities and the effectiveness of management measures to conserve them. The observations of physical parameters in the strait have shown large, long-term fluctuations in turbidity. The aim of this project was to establish an automatic system for continuous monitoring of water turbidity, and other relevant physicalparameters including temperature, salinity and meteorological variables.","Using an automated system for continuous monitoring, water turbidity, temperature and salinity were measured, along with meteorological variables (wind speed and direction, wind gust speed, atmospheric pressure, air temperature, rainfall). A Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) sensor, fitted with Optical Backscatter (OBS) sensor measuring backscattered light at 880nm was used for oceanographic measurements. Weather stations in Menai Bridge and Caernarfon airport provided meteorological data. CTD monitoring was carried out at one fixed site at the Low Water Springs mark off the end of the rock jetty on Ynys Faelog in the Menai Strait. Meteorological data came from weather stations in Menai Bridge and Caernarfon airport. Automatically collected data was logged every 5 minutes. The recorded observations were collected from 2003-2005. Instrument calibration data is included, and described in detail in CCW Marine Monitoring Report No. 22. Secchi depth measurements have been made sporadically in the strait for the last 40 years (Lumb, 1989,1990; Birkett and Maggs, 2001, Kratzer et al., 2003). These show that there was a steady decrease in water clarity in the strait between the early 1960's and the early 1980's, but that since then, clarity has been improving so that Secchi depths are more or less back to the levels they were 40 years ago.",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,,,,,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of a usage rule could not be expected to yield amounts of confiscated quota anywhere near the figures quoted above. The figure for those who have produced under 70% for three consecutive years matches the favoured usage rule option (if one were to be applied) amongst the respondents to the original consultation exercise.","This data extract was taken from the Rural Payments Agency Operations team source of reports, the data has been formated to ensure it complies with Data Protection Act and publishing guidelines.",,Reviewed - unsure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to develop a computer model to map areas of potential marine recreation in England and support data previously gathered on marine recreation to support the decision making process of marine planning.,"The analysis grid allows the model to assess each cell (assigned a unique identifier, GID) of the model extent against the influence of the 24 input parameter data layers. These 24 Input parameters are: Baseline Activity Areas, Estuary Areas, Land Access Points, Car Parks Presence, Marina Distance, Mooring Distance, Slipway Distance, Land Habitats, Intertidal Habitats, Birds on Land, Land Reserves, Water Depth, Wind Magnitude, Wave Height, Water Quality, Subtidal Habitats (Reef and Hard Substrate), Seahorses, Cetaceans, Basking Sharks, Seals at Sea, Birds at Sea, Accessible Wrecks, Leisure Navigation, Restricted Areas. A scoring matrix was applied to the model, which scored each of the parameters according to their influence on the recreation activity being modelled. For each cell the model totalled (TSCORE) the scores of each parameter in a given cell; the cells with the highest score = most potential for recreation for that recreation activity, and vice versa. These scores and criteria were informed through recreation stakeholder consultation. Additional attribute fields include (a) the characteristic of the cell in terms of each of the 24 input parameters (columns before TSCORE); and (b) the score for each of these 24 parameters based on the activity preferences (columns after TSCORE).

The purpose of the generalised modelling project was to fill the gaps where there was no detailed local modelled data in 2004, in order to define the extents of Flood Zones for spatial planning. The purpose of this climate change data was to provide a high-level sensitivity analysis of the possible effects of climate change based on a 20% increase in peak flows in the fluvial modelling. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model called JFlow was used to produce this modelled fluvial flood depth data on a 5x5m grid.

Marine_Scotland_FishDAC_1503,6098,MEDIN Sample,Marine Scotland,biota,,Monitoring the Consequences of the Northwestern North Sea Sandeel Fishery Closure,Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Volume 1 No 6,"By 1997 sandeel abundance on the Wee Bankie was already depressed as a result of fishing activities, and continuation of the fishery up to 1999 caused further declines. As a precautionary measure to safeguard marine top predators, particularly seabirds at internationally important colonies in and around the Firth of Forth, an area off the east coast of Scotland, from Rattray Head to St Abbs, was closed to industrial fishing for sandeels in 2000. High levels of recruitment in 1999 and 2000, combined with a lack of any significant fishing activity in 1999, resulted in an immediate and substantial increase in the biomass of sandeels on the Wee Bankie grounds in 2000; the first year of the sandeel closure. Since 2001, sandeel biomass has steadily declined to levels in 2007 that were similar to those observed in 1997 and 1998 when the sandeel fishery in the area was active. In the absence of sustained recruitment, consumption by marine top predators, along with other causes of natural mortality, have exceeded growth production in the population. Closing the area to fishing has not been sufficient to ensure high abundances of sandeels in the area. Recruitment of young sandeels, at or above long-term average levels, is also necessary, and since this is primarily governed by natural process, this may be beyond the capacity of fisheries management alone to achieve. Variation in the abundance and feeding ecology of gadoid predators in the study area was unrelated to variation in sandeel abundance and so remained unaffected by closure of the fishery. Numbers of guillemots, razorbills, puffins and kittiwakes recorded at sea in the study area all appeared to increase with closure of the fishery, and then subsequently to decline again as local sandeel abundance declined. The increase in auk abundance at sea may well have resulted from an influx of non-breeding birds. Only the breeding performance of kittiwakes at the Isle of May appeared related to variation in local sandeel abundance. Simply closing offshore areas close to top predator colonies may not be sufficient to guarantee the long term prospects of predators at these locations.","The study area covered most of two ICES statistical rectangles, 41E7 and 41E8, between latitudes 56o 00‚ÄôN and 56o 30‚ÄôN and longitudes 003o 00‚ÄôW and 001o 00‚ÄôW (Figure 3.1). Fishery-independent acoustic, and demersal trawl surveys were undertaken using the Scottish Fisheries Research Vessels Clupea (up to and including 2007) and Alba na Mara (from 2008 onwards). All acoustic and demersal trawl survey work was carried out between 0300h and 1500h GMT between late May and early July of each year from 1997 to 2009, apart from 2004 when acoustic and demersal trawl survey work was not undertaken.Predatory fish biomass in the study area was assessed using the demersal trawl surveys and applying an identical methodology as for assessing sandeel, herring and sprat local biomass.Numbers of seabird predators using the study area was assessed using a variable width (150m to 300m, depending on weather and sea state conditions) transect to one side of the vessel while the ship was engaged in acoustic survey passage.",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
546,546,NE Sample,Natural England,geoscientificInformation,Geographic Information,Moorland Deep Peat AP Status,,"The Peat Layer was produced by Natural England (ARM team) during June-October 2008, with the aim of identifying the extent of three classes of peaty soils for the purposes of the Partnership Project to Protect and Enhance Peat Soils (aka. The Peat Project).  The Peat Project is a joint initiative of Defra, Natural England, the Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Welsh Assembly Government, Countryside Council for Wales, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Cadw and the Department for Energy and Climate Change, and aims to improve coordination between these partners in our efforts to understand, manage and restore peaty soils.BGS, Cranfield University (NSRI) and OS must be acknowledged in any reports or documents produced as a result of using the Peat layer.","Several data layers were used in the geoprocessing to create the Moorland Deep AP Status data.The approach involved identifying areas of deep peat within the Moorland Line using soil, geological drift and habitat mapping, and using aerial photographs taken between 1999-2008, to create maps of visible peatland status and land use.National Soils map data © Cranfield University, BGS geology data and blanket bog data taken from the National Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) were used to show the location of peaty soils. This provided an indicative layer for the area of peat and peat soils in England. Soils classed as “deep peaty soils” were selected for use in this project. Moorland line classification was used to select upland areas from within this mapped area of deep peaty soils. The moorland line is mapped to represent areas of unimproved, moorland vegetation representations to remove areas of non-moorland land from the moorland line. As such, it represents our best mapping of upland moorland in England, and should contain no areas of non-moorland vegetation larger than 5ha in size. This provides a map of deep peaty soils under moorland vegetation. In addition, all areas under 1ha were deleted from the data set. The aim of this was to remove all areas which were smaller than the minimum mappable unit for this exercise and to reduce the total number of polygons to be assessed, while maintaining the greatest possible assessment area.

It links ArcView 8 GIS and ORACLE (a relational database management system, or RDMS). Spatial information (polygons covering acquisitions and disposals of land areas, FC accesses, FC servitudes, legal boundaries) and deeds database information (attributes) are all managed within ArcView 8.      The use of ArcSDE software sitting on a server in each territorial MGIU location further enhances the system by storing both the spatial data and the deeds attribute data in the same Oracle file, which also allows multi-user access to the data.  The use of SDE also means backup arrangements are easier, since both the spatial and attribute data are backed up at the same time.       Maintenance Functions in the Deed Management Extension:   1.

The map shows the extent of all woodland of 0.5 ha. Woodland categories are defined by IFT (Interpreted Forest Type) values. Detailed Woodland categories are: Broadleaved Conifer Felled Ground Prepared for New Planting Mixed - predominantly Broadleaved Mixed - predominantly Conifer Young Trees Coppice Coppice with Standards Shrub Land Uncertain Cloud or Shadow Low Density Assumed woodland Non woodland categories are defined by the IOA (Interpreted Open Area) values. Detailed Non woodland categories are: Agriculture land Bare area Grass Open water Other vegetation Power line Quarry River Road Urban Windfarm,"All woodland (both urban and rural, regardless of ownership) which is 0.5ha or greater in extent, with the exception of Assumed woodland or Low density areas that can be 0.1ha or greater in extend, as been mapped Woodland that is less than 0.5ha in extent will not be described within the dataset but will be included in a separate sample survey of small woodland and tree features. Attributes The structure of the schema has been changed since the 2011 woodland map release, to maintain compatibility with the new NFI update and reporting tool. Category: Woodland (W) The woodland polygons represent the extent of mapped woodland >= 0.5 ha; Non woodland (NW) The 'non-woodland' polygons represent open areas completely surrounded by woodland also >= 0.5 ha; Descriptions of Interpreted Forest Types (IFTs) Conifer (C) Coniferous woodland often occurs as large plantations with trees in regular rows and the stand edges may be regular and sharply defined. Some broadleaved trees may also be present but greater than 80% of the area will consist of conifers. Broadleaved (B) The canopy of broadleaved woodland is generally more uneven than that of coniferous woodland being made up of rounded crowns but with variations according to species, age, height, and season. Boundaries with adjacent internal polygons are generally less clearly defined than with conifers and naturally occurring stands may grade into adjacent ones with no sharp division. Some coniferous trees may be present but greater than 80% of the area will consist of broadleaved trees. Mixed (Mc) Predominantly conifer The interpretation of Mixed woodland can be very difficult as it exhibits intermediate characteristics between Conifer and Broadleaved woodland. There can be several types of mixed woodland. A plantation of alternate rows of conifer and broadleaves may produce a 'striped' appearance. You may see conifer and broadleaves planted in blocks, and there may be general intersperse woodland. The proportion of the Conifer will be more than 50% of the area and less than 80%. Mixed (Mb) Predominantly broadleaved The interpretation of Mixed woodland can be very difficult as it exhibits intermediate characteristics between Conifer and Broadleaved woodland. There can be several types of mixed woodland. A plantation of alternate rows of conifer and broadleaves may produce a 'striped' appearance. You may see conifer and broadleaves planted in blocks, and there may be general intersperse woodland. The proportion of the Broadleaves will be more than 50% of the area and less than 80%. Coppice (O) The most important characteristic of coppice areas on aerial photographs is its very even, smooth appearance. The coppice area may be made up of a patchwork of different ages (heights) but all show this very even character. Areas recently cut may appear to have a very clear floor with little felling debris. Coppice-with-Standards (P) Some areas of coppice also include larger broadleaved trees set in the coppice matrix. These broadleaved trees, often oak, are known as standards and show very clearly over the even coppice as large rounded crowns. The distribution of the standards may also be fairly scattered with approximately 25 per ha. Shrub Land (S) This category is intended to include areas that may possibly be woodland, where the growth is close to the ground and shows a rough character but no clear differentiation between Conifer and Broadleaved can yet be made. Areas being colonised by woody species may fall into this category. The cover will be at least 20%. Young Trees (N) Areas where planting is clearly visible but the trees cannot yet be allocated between Conifer and Broadleaved due to their immaturity. These areas can be on either land new to woodland or where a felled crop has been replaced. Felled Woodland (F) Areas of woodland where the trees have been harvested or felled. Stumps or felled trees may be visible and there may be long heaps of felling debris ('windrows'). Some standing trees within this limit may also be present but should be disregarded. This category should not be confused with Coppice. The areas concerned may also have been re-stocked but the new trees are not yet visible. Ground Prepared for New Planting (G) Land in this category is area recently converted from some other land use to woodland and will show plough furrows or mounding but the new planting (if present) cannot yet be discerned Cloud or Shadow Areas (CS) If cloud or shadow areas obscure woodland detail and it is difficult to allocate one of the above IFTs, then digitise a new boundary line feature around the area of uncertain forest type. Uncertain Areas (X) Where the interpreter is uncertain of the IFT/IOA to be used X will be designated. The rate of use of this category should decline over time as operators become more proficient and better at recognising IFT/IOAs. As part of the QA procedures X's will be checked and operators found using this code frequently will be subject to more intensive QA procedures and possibly more training. Low density (Ld) This category intended to include areas that have less than 20% canopy cover that might have potential to achieve woodland in the future. These areas will be monitored in future updates and either updated to reflect forest type or removed from the dataset. Assumed woodland (Aw) The supplied grant scheme and FC new planting polygons have been attributed as 'assumed woodland' as these areas have not been checked against the latest images and will be monitored in future updates and either updated to reflect forest type or removed from the dataset. Descriptions of Interpreted Open Areas (IOAs) Open water (W) Normally labelled within OSMM, areas of even colour Grass (Gs) A predominantly grassy area - may be agricultural or not. Agricultural land (Ag) May contain a cereal crop or pasture. Urban/Building (U) Buildings within woodland areas, may include gardens surrounding the building Forest road, track (Ro) Linear feature, often fairly straight with gentle bends or turning circles. River (Ri) Linear feature, depending on location can be fairly straight or meander through woodland. Powerline (L) Possible shadow evidence of poles, pylons or even the cable/lines. Quarry (Q) Show change in vegetation to geology, sand, slate, rock etc. Active quarries could have buildings, heavy plant tracks leading into the quarry. Bare (Ba) Bare ground/rock Windfarm (Wf) Possible shadow evidence of turbines, normally in groups Other vegetation (V) Not covered by the above, e.g. Gorse, Rhododendron, Bracken, Heather etc. Notes: Species such as Gorse and Rhododendron are not regarded as woodland and have therefore been excluded. Orchards are not regarded as woodland but have been mapped for carbon accounting purposes. Details can be provided on request. Interpreted Forest Types are only used to classify polygons in the NFI digital woodland map. IFTs are useful when using the map without the sample data, and for smaller geographic areas where the sample data would be inappropriate.

Areas, such as urban and littoral rock, are not sampled by CS and therefore have no associated data. Also, in some circumstances sample sizes for particular habitat / parent material combinations were insufficient to estimate mean values.

This was a follow up survey to the previous work carried out in this area in 2011 (2011/4). QICS (Quantifying and monitoring potential ecosystem impacts of geological carbon storage) was a scientific research project funded by NERC; its purpose was to improve the understanding of the sensitivities of the UK marine environment to a potential leak from a carbon capture storage (CCS) system. The aim of the survey was to assess any affect the drilling of the borehole had on the underlying sediments. Sea floor bathymetry data were collected using a Kongsberg EM3002D multibeam system. Sub bottom seismic profiling data were collected using an Applied Acoustics surface tow boomer (STB). These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in the BGS Report of Survey. Webpage www.bgs.ac.uk/QICS/.,"Geophysical equipment types used included: Surface Tow Boomer. British Geological Survey was contracted to undertake the survey on behalf of Natural Environment Research Council. Seismic lines from the previous survey (2011-04) were re-run using a Surface Tow Boomer for a direct comparison to see if the underlying sediments had been disturbed by the drill; further lines were added for greater data density. Lines were run east to west, parallel with the contours, with 100% overlap to ensure safety in the shallow water. 20 lines were completed in total; an area of 1km2 was completed with lines approx 500m in length. A multibeam survey was run successfully using a Kongsberg EM3002D multibeam system; the aim was to find concrete blocks on the seabed that were anchoring a cable related to the drill operation.

Great crested newts (GCN), alongside other species listed in Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive, are afforded particular protection because of their conservation status at a European scale. This species is widespread in Europe, but has declined since the 1940s. In the UK, GCN are widespread and locally common, with a patchy distribution, especially in South West England, parts of Wales, and in Scotland. A requirement of the Habitats Directive of each EU member state is to ensure that European Protected Species are maintained at or restored to ‘favourable conservation status’ across their natural range. In order to better understand the conservation status of the species in England, a much better understanding is needed of the distribution and extent of the population of the species in its natural range, and the habitat available to it. This project forms part of a series of projects to produce an enhanced evidence base which can be used to inform decisions about land-use planning and determining conservation status.  It is the first of a two-stage exercise to collect data to develop a model for predicting the presence of GCN.  Potential applications of a predictive model could include earlier identification of areas where GCN can be ruled in or out as a concern in land-use planning decisions.

Throughout, fishing took place in the northern North Sea, but for the most part focused on ICES Division IVa).Data collectionSelf samplingEstimating fish numbers and weightsThe skipper and crew were asked to provide estimates of the weight and number of retained and discarded cod and saithe of each size grade for every haul. At the end of each haul, fishroom staff provided the wheelhouse a tally recording the number of baskets per grade of cod and saithe caught. Baskets were estimated at 45 kg, and the numbers of fish in each basket were assessed regularly (to take into account the seasonal and spatial variations of fish condition).Biotic and abiotic measurementsAll cod were caught in every haul were measured, and a minimum of 100 saithe per size grade were measured per trip. When necessary (large hauls), saithe numbers were raised to haul level as a proportion of the total catch, using volume-based raising factors. All fish were measured to the nearest centimetre below (total length). Environmental conditions (sea state, wind strength/ direction) and physical conditions (depth, position, haul-duration and gear properties) were recorded along with the biological data.Observer samplingThree observer trips were conducted throughout the study period. The first observer trip, in May 2007, was used to train the skipper and crew of the ‚ÄúFarnella‚Äù in sampling methods. The second and third observer trips were used to maintain the standards applied from the start (there was skipper and crew turnover) and particularly to ensure that the self-sampling was of a very high standard. These second two observer trips were carried out in the first quarters of 2008 and 2009. Information collected from the trained observers was used to validate the data provided by the vessel and to provide a more detailed overview of the fishery with respect to bycatch and discards.Fish age determinationA total of 29 000 fish otoliths was removed at sea by observers and from fish landed to fish markets. Of these, 15 500 were from cod and 13 500 from saithe. All otoliths were extracted from fish that had been caught in ICES area IVa between April 2007 and March 2009 (the study period covered by this report). Otoliths were mounted, sectioned, stained, read, and re-read for quality control purposes, according to the protocols of Cefas and Marine Scotland - Marine Laboratory.Data analysisData handlingTrip, haul, length, catch and age data were entered onto a MS access database. All data entered were cross-checked against the paperwork and quality-controlled for inaccuracies. Data were handled using SPSS V17 statistical software, charts were produced using Sigmaplot V10.0, and maps were created in MapInfo V7.8.Converting fish length into fish agesAge-at-length data collected from the 15 500 cod and 13 500 saithe that were aged were used. Data were collected throughout the year to take into account length variations of a growing age class. At a given length in any quarter, fish age will vary. For example, in quarter 3 of 2007, 49 cod of the 70-cm length class were aged as between one and four years old, so when one 70-cm cod was observed and measured in quarter 3, it was aged proportionally to what was observed in the population. Each fish length has a different combination of proportions at a given age. If more than one fish was observed at a given length, then the number at length was multiplied by the proportion at age to give the estimated numbers at a given age. Age-length keys (ALKs) applied to this analysis are area- (ICES IVa), species- (cod or saithe) and season-specific (quarters 1, 2, 3 and 4). Sex is not taken into account. When a fish length could not be matched with a length that had been aged in a particular quarter, then seasonality was removed and an aggregated ALK for the whole year was used. This occurred in &lt;2% of the &gt;75 000 fish measured.Generating an age-category keyHaul data are presented in numbers of fish caught by category. In order to make use of this information and to evaluate the numbers-at-age of fish caught at a particular haul location, we need to understand the age spread of a particular category. Fishermen were asked to record the category of the fish measured. With each measurement we can assess the age of the fish, so an area, species and season age-category key can be generated. For example, in quarter 3 of 2007, an estimated 1 990 category 4 cod were caught. These were aged between 2 and 6 years old, so when a category 4 fish was caught (now disregarding length information) we applied the same method as an ALK and aged it proportionally using an age category key (ACK). For example, If 1000 category 4 cod were caught in a particular haul, we would estimate 533 to be age 2 (1000 x 0.533), 398 to be age 3 (1000 x 0.398), 66 to be age 4, etc.Calculating catch per unit effortThe total numbers of fish caught each month (by species) were divided by the total haul duration to determine the numbers of fish caught per hour, or the catch per unit effort (CPUE). This unit allowed the catch data to be standardised and used for comparative analysis.SummaryThe Northern North Sea Saithe (and Cod) FSP was established in response to an industry- and science-perceived absence of realistic data on the 2004 and 2005 year classes of saithe and the 2005 and 2006 year classes of cod. The 2005 and 2004 year classes of saithe (4 and 5 year olds) are of particular interest because they were predicted to contribute significantly to projected landings in 2008 and subsequently to contribute to the spawning-stock biomass of the species in 2009. This study uses data collected at haul level by fishermen aboard the commercial fishing vessel MFV ‚ÄúFarnella‚Äù over a two-year period. Throughout, fishing was widespread in the northern North Sea, but for the most part was focused on ICES Division IVa. The skipper and crew were trained in sampling techniques prior to collecting the data. and all information sent ashore was checked regularly. Observer-accompanied trips were also carried out to ensure a high standard of data quality. Between May 2007 and March 2009 (the study period) MFV ‚ÄúFarnella‚Äù embarked on 51 commercial fishing trips in the northern North Sea (ICES IVa), hauled 1154 times, and caught 3.3 million saithe (Pollachius virens) and 51 000 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Of the fish caught, the crew measured most of the cod (48 772) and 26 518 saithe (75 290 in total).",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Responsible Party: Environment Agency (pointOfContact) EnvironmentThe Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic know as the OSPAR Convention 1998 (Oslo Convention 1972 & Paris Convention 1974), is an agreement signed by a number of European countries (including the United Kingdom) to protect the quality of the North East Atlantic. The objective of the OSPAR Convention is to take all possible steps to prevent and eliminate pollution entering the sea. The OSPAR Convention provides standard methods for estimating the inputs of selected pollutants to the sea by using fixed sampling schedule and a standard input calculation. All principal rivers are sampled monthly (12 times a year) just upstream of their tidal limits. For those rivers carrying the heaviest contaminant loads the sampling frequency maybe increased beyond the minimum of 12. Major trade effluents and sewage effluents to estuaries or coastal waters are also sampled monthly to assess direct discharges to marine waters. Flow values of discharges direct to estuary or sea are sometimes provided by the operators themselves. This is usually part of statutory monitoring arrangements. The aim of these programmes is to assess the level of contamination entering the sea from England and Wales (the ‘load’) and to chart the progress in the reduction of this load. The substances controlled under OSPAR are: Mercury, Cadmium, Copper, Zinc, Lead, PCB, gamma-HCH, Orthophosphate, Phosphorous (total), Nitrate, Nitrogen (total) and suspended particulate material. The load of contamination to the sea is measured at over 300 sites around the coast of England and Wales. These sites have been grouped into thirty two coastal zones. OSPAR data is updated annually approximately 6 months through the year for the previous year. Data held ranges from 1998 to the present. It’s high/low based on twelve annual samples. This product provides a pair of annual estimates for each sampling point, known as high load, and low load. The difference between the high and low load estimates is owing to the way in which the samples with results at the 'limit of detection' are treated. The limit of detection is the lowest concentration of a substance that can be reliably measured – any real concentration lower than this level, including zero, is reported as being present at “less than” the limit of detection concentration. Where the substance has been analysed for but the concentration is below the limit of detection, a calculation can be made assuming that it is not present at all (a low load estimate). Alternatively, a calculation can be made by assuming that the substance is present exactly at the limit of detection (a high load estimate). The low load calculation gives an optimistic estimate of the real load, whereas the high load calculation gives a pessimistic estimate. The real load discharged will be somewhere between these two figures.

SNH and JNCC then support the consultation over proposed sites with owners, occupiers, planning authorities and other interested parties on behalf of the Scottish Ministers.        Boundary definition process: The pMPA boundaries in the dataset have been subjected to a boundary setting exercise; this will be completed for the 4 MPA search locations if their status were to change to possible MPAs.       Boundary definition:       - Is normally based on OS Mastermap Mean Low water Springs (MLWS) or Mean High Water Springs (MHWS) dependent on proposed protected feature composition;       - Excludes significant coastal infrastructure;       - Follows the boundaries of existing protected areas for consistency and where appropriate (to simplify any future management discussions should the possible MPAs progress);       - For sites where black guillemots are a feature, the boundary of the possible MPA follows the natural break between the marine and terrestrial environment (i.e. the top of cliffs or back of storm beach/ rocky shores) and unless the presence of other features dictates otherwise, the seaward boundary extends 2 km from MLWS or to a maximum depth of 50 m.

677,677,NE Sample,Environment Agency,environment ,hydropower,Potential_sites_of_Hydropower,,"This record is for Approval for Access product AfA175. These data show the location of opportunities for hydropower and the basic environmental sensitivity associated with exploiting them in England and Wales. A total of 25,935 ‘barriers’ are identified and assessed in this project. The term ‘barriers’ is used to describe sites with sufficient drop to provide a hydropower opportunity. They are mostly weirs, but could also be other man-made structures or natural features, such as waterfalls. The average maximum power generation capacity on a barrier was 45Kw, with a total potential capacity of 1178Mw. Environmental sensitivities were assessed. This assessment considered the presence of fish species and whether the site has been designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). Almost half (46%) of these barriers are classified as highly sensitive, mostly because of the presence of migratory fish species such as salmon and eel. 27% are medium and high sensitivity, and the remainder are unclassified due to a lack of data. When it is assumed that a new scheme has a fish pass built into it, the environmentally compatible opportunities increase considerably. A filtered dataset is also available based on potential power output and environmental sensitivity, AfA206 'Potential Sites of Hydropower Opportunity - filtered'. Given the scale of the project and the data used, the results are not intended to replace any part of an individual site assessment. Instead, the dataset gives national and regional level overviews of the potential opportunities available, their locations, and their relative environmental sensitivity to exploitation. INFORMATION WARNING These data are intended to provide national and regional overviews of the potential hydropower opportunities available, their locations, and their relative environmental sensitivity to exploitation. At site-level, there will be some error inherent in the results as the map uses a national GIS dataset that is based on various sources. One-third of the sites where older ‘Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data was used for the height estimate include an error of up to one metre. The remaining two-thirds use ‘Light Detection and Ranging’ (LIDAR), which is accurate to 25cm. This means that the data for an individual site may be inaccurate, but at the national and regional level the error will be averaged out to an extent. There is not a high level of confidence in the power generation calculation. The power category takes account of this uncertainty. These data are indicative only and are not intended to replace any part of an individual site assessment, which is necessary for a full scheme appraisal.

The UK BAP habitats and species lists have been used to draw statutory lists of priority habitats as required under Section 42 of the Natural Environmental and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006. The habitats listed as priority habitats include; blue mussel beds, Fragile sponge and anthozoan communities, Tide swept channels, Horse mussel beds, Maerl beds, Honeycomb worm reefs, Seagrass beds, Oyster beds, Intertidal boulder communities, Intertidal mudflats, mud habitats in deep water, Sheltered muddy gravels, subtidal mixed muddy sediments, Estuarine rocky habitats, Peat and clay exposures, Carbonate reefs, Musculus discors beds, Saline lagoons, Coastal Saltmarsh and Subtidal sands and gravels.The data is related to fragile sponge and anthozoan only. Anthozoans are a group of soft animals with feathery tentacles, which includes soft corals, sea-fans, cup corals and anemones. Members of this group can be found together with branching sponges on steeply sloping bedrock or large boulders in depths from about 50m to just below low tide. These sponge and anthozoan communities require sufficient water movement to bring a ready supply of food but not too much, as they are vulnerable to breakage. As a result, they are found on shores which are exposed to moderate or strong waves and possibly quite strong tidal currents, but only in areas of those shores where there is some local shelter from the full force of the waves and tides. Majority of the records are from the 1960s onwards. This data is still in draft format and has not yet been finalised. All habitat records include a confidence measure. Decisions about how these were applied are documented in the processing notes for each habitats.","The data was collated from a wide range of sources, including but not limited to Marine Recorder, Phase 1 Intertidal, HabMap, Marine Monitoring Data. Habitats layers were produced as both polygon and point data for many of the habitats. Each layer is accompanied by processing notes detailing data sources and all decisions made in creating the layers. A standard template was also produced and documented for attributing the GIS layers and general assumptions that could be made.

Underway automatic sampling followed by flow cytometry was used for assessing mesoscale spatial variability of microorganisms. Coarse-scale (CTD) and fine-scale (PumpCast profiler) vertical distribution of microorganisms was determined, with dominant microbial prokaryotic and eukaryotic groups quantified by flow cytometry. Samples were collected and processed for subsequent molecular identification of flow cytometrically sorted dominant microbes. Abundance of larger microplankton organisms was assessed. Microbial respiration in the twilight zone was studied. Group-specific uptake of bicarbonate, phosphate and different nitrogen compounds was determined and group-specific production and grazing assessed using flow sorting. The ambient turnover rates of phosphate, organic phosphorus and labile dissolved organic matter, e.g. amino acids, was bioassayed. In order to put the microbial community data into context, physical and chemical parameters were measured. A ship mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was used to collect information about physical, mesoscale spatial context and, when combined with turbulence profiler data, SeaSoar profiler data and data collected using intensive Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) sampling for dissolved inorganic nutrients, may estimate mesoscale nutrient fluxes into the photic zone. PELAGRA neutral buoyancy sediment traps were used to estimate biogenic sedimentation. Samples were collected for particulate calcite, opal, and Particulate Organic Matter (POM) measurements, together with the isotopic composition of Particulate Organic Nitrogen (PON). Data collection was in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre between 9th August and 15th September 2011 during RRS Discovery cruise D369.

This dataset is the product of the first detailed assessment of the character of Wales's seascapes. The purpose of this data capture was to characterise and define the geographical extent of the seascape units of Wales and to assess the sensitivity of each seascape to offshore developments. The dataset contains a map, images, and descriptive text for each of the 50 seascapes units in Wales. Also included are maps illustrating the national and regional divisions of seascape units, land with sea views, relative visibility of the sea surface from land and tranquillity. There are also maps presenting the results of sensitivity assessments carried out to model the sensitivity of seascape units to offshore wind farm developments, wave farm developments and tidal stream developments. Included in the dataset is a pdf file outlining what exactly the MapInfo files in the dataset show.","The assessment was carried out at a regional scale, producing 50 regional seascape units to cover the whole of Wales. Each was described in terms of key characteristics and special qualities as well as being assessed for its sensitivity to offshore wind, wave and tidal stream developments. The maps were derived from OS and digital terrain modelling data. The data has been thoroughly quality assessed by NRW's Geographical Information Unit to ensure that it's technically sound as well as fit for purpose. The project is seminal work and as a result has produced the only dataset of its kind. INFORMATION WARNING: The 2009 report has since been partly superseded by more recent work by White Consultants (2019) 'Seascape and visual sensitivity to offshore wind farms in Wales: Strategic assessment and guidance. Stage 3 - Seascape and visual sensitivity assessment for offshore wind farms. NRW Evidence Report No. 331'. The data relating to the level of sensitivity or capacity to accommodate offshore wind, wave or tidal stream developments is out of date and should not be used as evidence. The narrative descriptions in the written report and the and spatial division of the Welsh coastline into 50 regional seascape units may be of continuing assistance in understanding the variety and character of different coastal landscapes in Wales.",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Sensitive Catchment Integrated Modelling Analysis Platform (SCIMAP) is a sediment risk assessment model which uses a digital terrain elevation, land use or land cover data and rainfall data to give an indication of where the relative risk of sediment erosion and delivery to a watercourse is greatest in a catchment. This model was run for the catchments of 31 N2K or SSSI sites that are impacted by diffuse pollution.  This outputs consists of three layers 1) Erosion risk - This is a measure of the relative risk of sediment mobilisation and delivery 2) In-channel concentration risk - this is a measure of the relative risk of erosion leading to an increase in sediment concentration in the watercourse 3) Network Index - a relative measure of hydrological connectivity and propensity to generate overland flow.  For each of the 31 N2K or SSSI site catchments the model was run at a resolution of 5m.  However for larger catchments 5m resolution could only be run at a sub catchment level, with whole catchment run at a lower resolution (of either 10m, 15m 20m or 25m depending on the size of the catchment.)

The first of a series of SCM work consisted of quantitative drop-down video surveys as well as the collection of 72 infaunal grab samples and granulometry samples for Particle Size Analysis (PSA) in 2016. Sampling locations are randomly selected within nine depth stratified sampling boxes.","The Sound of Barra Special Area of Conservation (SAC) was designated in 2013 to afford protection for the marine features Sandbanks which are slightly covered by sea water all the time, Reefs, and Harbour seal populations. Survey work has been undertaken to improve knowledge of the habitats and species that occur in these sites and to monitor the features of interest within these sites to allow for temporal analysis of the protected features. In 2016, infaunal grab and Particle Size Analysis (PSA) samples (using a 0.1m2 Day grab) and DDV run data were collected from randomly selected locations - largely dependent on tidal/wind conditions - within nine pre-defined target survey boxes placed inside and outside the Sound of Barra SAC. Sampling was restricted to within the boxes to reduce variability and increase the statistical power for assessing a change in biological communities over time. Note: some of the areas such as S7 and S8 had not been surveyed previously. Therefore this project serves a secondary purpose - to increase our knowledge of the extent and distribution of the subtidal habitats in this area. This series of SCM surveys serves to provide 1) information to underpin future status assessments of the Sound of Barra SAC, and 2) as part of a programme for refining the distribution of Habitat Directive Annex I habitats.",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a product of the interaction of the natural and cultural components of our environment, and how they are understood and experienced by people.  This work was commissioned to test and refine the emerging methodology for assessing the character of seascapes and to: 1 Contribute to the aims of the European Landscape Convention to promote landscape protection, management and planning, and to support European co-operation on landscape issues. 2 Provide practical tools and evidence to assist in responding to the increasing demands being placed upon the related marine and terrestrial environments, building upon the increased awareness of the high profile of the connections between land and sea reflected in the Marine and Coastal Access Act (2009) and the resultant marine spatial planning system. 3 Undertake a Seascape Character Assessment at a strategic scale for a defined area of the English coastline, so that a baseline of Seascape Character Areas is available to: provide the context for more detailed Seascape Character Assessment work; Inform Marine Spatial Planning, and the planning, design and management of developments – and a range of other projects – on and around our coastline.","Character areas have been defined as the product of broad associations of distinct elements.  These fall broadly into those within a perceptible visual influence from land and those areas which are offshore where the influence is derived from below sea level processes which may in turn present themselves as surface sea use activities. Where areas associate with perceptible land influences, these are typically given land defined area names. Refer to Figures 1.13 and 2.12 for the extent and naming of character areas identified as an outcome of this assessment.  Boundaries are open ended and approximate in position. As such the limits of character areas at unbounded extents are not defined within the scope of the study and will need to be validated by further survey work within adjacent Marine Plan Areas.  Following consideration of the detail within the various topic headings, the baseline context was interpreted into the individual character areas to define their key characteristics, physical influences, cultural influences and aesthetic and perceptual qualities. The characterisation does not go so far as to identify forces for change or objectives as the focus is on providing an understanding of baseline context rather than to make judgement on the significance of the resource.  With the relative scale of this characterisation process, The Humber Estuary and The Wash have been delineated as individual character areas due to their generally enclosed nature, their closer visual association with the surrounding landscape and their identifiable estuarine characteristics. Smaller estuarine environments such as The Exe estuary have been excluded from the physical extent of the seascape character area boundary as their scale would be more identifiable with the land based character areas at the current scale level of assessment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dataset consists of 3 shapefiles showing the extent of Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) (UWWTD) sensitive areas (eutrophic).  The UWWTD describes eutrophication as ‘the enrichment of water by nutrients, especially compounds of nitrogen and/or phosphorous, causing an accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms present in the water and to the quality of the water concerned’. The UWWTD regulates the collection and treatment of waste water from homes and from industry. In the UK, the Directive is implemented through the Urban Wastewater Treatment Regulations 1994. Under these Regulations, water bodies that are (or may soon become) eutrophic should be designated as sensitive areas by Defra. This applies to still fresh waters, rivers, estuaries and coastal waters.

SHINE (standing for Selected Heritage Inventory for Natural England) is a single, nationally consistent dataset of undesignated historic environment features from across England that could benefit from management within Natural England's Countryside Stewardship scheme.  Data about suitable sites is created by local authority Historic Environment Records (HERs) and fed into the national SHINE dataset. You can use the 'Look up a Record' tab on the left-hand side of this page to see the available information for a SHINE site shown in your CS or ES Environmental Information Map & Record. Enter the SHINE record number e.g. SA12345. This search can also be used to look up the full designation text (where published by Historic England) for Scheduled Monuments.  This dataset (which also appears on the Environmental Information Maps provided with CS application packs) shows applicants where selected historic environment features can be found on their holding. We hope that the SHINE dataset will result in more monuments being entered into beneficial management by farmers and land managers entering into Countryside Stewardship agreements. The SHINE dataset may be added to, and reported back to you, as part of the pre-application Historic Environment FER (HEFER) consultation process.

This dataset identifies which second generation Shoreline Management Plan is applicable to a particular stretch of coastline. It also identifies the policies which are applicable. It is a polyline, spatial data layer. A Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) is a large-scale assessment of the risks associated with coastal processes and helps reduce these risks to people and the developed, historic and natural environments. Coastal processes include tidal patterns, wave height, wave direction and the movement of beach and seabed materials. The SMPs provide a ‘route map’ for local authorities and other decision makers to move from the present situation towards meeting our future needs, and will identify the most sustainable approaches to managing the risks to the coast in the short term (0-20 years), medium term (20-50 years) and long term (50-100 years). INFORMATION WARNING This dataset was created for the purposes of creating a strategic overview map; as a consequence it was created at a notional scale of 1:250,000, this means that the definition of the breakpoints and the accuracy to which the SMP lengths reflect the 'coastline' is suitable for strategic level use only. Consideration should be given as to whether it should be replaced by a more accurate representation. More detailed representations of the SMP boundaries may be available at Local/Regional level.

778,778,NE Sample,Environment Agency,environment ,maps and mapping; geographic information; groundwater; water abstraction; industrial pollution; water quality; ,Source Protection Zones,,Source Protection Zones (Merged)' have been created as public facing boundaries where discrete groundwater bodies within Source Protection Zones (SPZ) have been dissolved on zone number where common boundaries and overlaps have been removed. SPZs are defined around large and public potable groundwater abstraction sites. The purpose of SPZs is to provide additional protection to safeguard drinking water quality through constraining the proximity of an activity that may impact upon a drinking water abstraction. This is part of an initial screening process in assessing impacts to groundwater resources. Zones around location sites are defined by groundwater travel time to an abstraction. This is determined through applying Environment Agency groundwater flow models run at the location of abstractions inputting parameters such as flow direction geology type rainfall and hydrological boundaries. SPZs provide a visual representation of the increased risks as you get closer to the abstraction. The following subdivisions are defined within SPZs: - Zone 1: (Inner Protection Zone) - This zone is defined by a travel time of 50-days or less from any point within the zone at or below the water table. Additionally the zone has as a minimum a 50-metre radius. It is based principally on biological decay criteria and is designed to protect against the transmission of toxic chemicals and water-borne disease. - Zone 2: (Outer Protection Zone) - This zone is defined by the 400-day travel time from a point below the water table. Additionally this zone has a minimum radius of 250 or 500 metres depending on the size of the abstraction. The travel time is derived from consideration of the minimum time required to provide delay dilution and attenuation of slowly degrading pollutants. - Zone 3: (Total catchment) - This zone is defined as the total area needed to support the abstraction or discharge from the protected groundwater source. A further Zone 4 or 'Zone of Special Interest' was previously defined for some groundwater sources. These zones highlighted areas (mainly on non-aquifers) where known local conditions meant that potentially polluting activities could impact on a groundwater source even though the area is outside the normal catchment of,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The forage fish populations inhabiting these waters provide a key source of prey for many predators, such as marine mammal and seabird species, including several of conservation concern, that either breed or overwinter in the study area. Given that several forage fish species in the northeast Atlantic have shown major changes in distribution and abundance, up-to-date information on their recent distribution patterns is important, including on where the main nursery and spawning grounds are presently located. The maps are provided for eleven fish species that are prey to marine mammals and seabirds: herring, sprat, sardine, anchovy, sandeel, horse mackerel, mackerel and garfish as well as the gadoid species poor cod, whiting and cod. Using survey data from 2008 to 2020, hotspot maps were created for adults and juveniles of each of the species. Data on most of the species was sparse and some of the gears used in fisheries surveys were not designed to catch the target species. However, a hotspot methodology allowed data from different gears to be standardised and combined into a composite map which covered most of the study area during two periods of the year (Quarter 1 and Quarter 4). Maps largely corresponded to those previously reported although several new species were included for which no or limited historic maps were available, specifically sprat, poor cod and garfish.","The focus of this study was spawning and nursery areas of forage fish in Welsh waters and surrounding shelf sea waters of the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and the western English Channel. Publicly available data from international fisheries-independent surveys were supplemented by data collected on surveys by Cefas.Data from three different types of surveys were considered for this study: pelagic (acoustic), demersal otter trawl (also referred to as bottom trawl) and beam trawl surveys. The available surveys included in this study covered two periods, between February and April and between September and December. To ensure the largest possible spatial coverage, surveys in either period were pooled and termed Quarter 1 and Quarter 4. Distribution of juveniles in both Quarters (chapter 4) was considered representative of the nursery grounds for the species. However, the distribution of adult fish was only assumed to represent spawning areas during the Quarter that coincided with the spawning period. For some species the peak spawning periods fell outside the survey periods in which case no spawning maps could be produced. However, the adult fish distribution maps during both Quarters were included in this report. The survey data used in this work are limited to waters more than ~20 m deep and the maps of the spawning and nursery areas in this report are therefore not representative of estuarine and transitional waters. as the catchability of species varies by survey and, particularly, gear type, averaging the species abundance data from different surveys, would not have been appropriate. To compensate for differences between surveys in gear selectivity, we created distribution maps for each species and size category by using a hotspot approach. This was based on a threshold, applied to the abundance data for each survey year separately. For each species and size category, these binary hotspot maps were then averaged across the surveys and years within a period (Quarter). A full description of the hotspot methodology used can be found in Campanella and van der Kooij (2021) (`https://waleslink.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1.-Spawning-and-nursery-grounds-of-forage-fish_CEFAS-project-report-for-RSPB.pdf`_).. _`https://waleslink.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1.-spawning-and-nursery-grounds-of-forage-fish_cefas-project-report-for-rspb.pdf`: https://waleslink.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1.-Spawning-and-nursery-grounds-of-forage-fish_CEFAS-project-report-for-RSPB.pdf",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Salinity, temperature and depth measurements were taken throughout the loch and revealed the presence of a distinct halocline and thermocline in the north basin of the loch at about 4 m depth, neither of which were present in the south basin. The salinity of the water above the halocline in the north basin and throughout the south basin was 13 - 14 ppt whilst that below the halocline had a maximum of 28.5 ppt. Temperature decreased by approximately 1 degree Centigrade at the level of the halocline and rose again by approximately 0.5 degree Centigrade near the bottom of the loch. The flora and fauna were investigated both by diving and by shore collections. Two distinct communities of plants and animals were found in the loch: i) A 'freshwater ' marginal component consisting of freshwater euryhaline species and true brackish water species found above the halocline in the north basin and throughout the south basin of the loch. ii) A marine component consisting of marine euryhaline species numerically dominated by the red alga Phyllophora pseudoceranoides and the tunicates Ciona intestinalis and Ascidiella aspersa.

Parallel surveys of the soft substrata and sublittoral hard substrata have also been conducted. The work was carried out during the summer of 1982 and subsequently supplemented by visits to less fully recorded sites. The purpose of this survey is to provide a topographical and biological description of the Anglesey and Arfon sides of the Menai Strait, concentrating on the hard or stable substrata and the animals and plants which live in these habitats. Flora and fauna lists are appended which cover all substrata. They are derived mainly from records in UCNW, Bangor, including those at the Marine Science Laborities, the School of Animal Biology and the School of Plant Biology. Additional records are from published material or personal information. Hard substrata have been studied rather longer than the soft, and littoral recording has been going on for longer than sublittoral work, but it has been highly selective; some areas of the Strait have been the subject of collecting and recording for many years; others have seldom been visited. This implies a judgement on the relative richness and interest and, in general, this difference in relative richness and interest is borne out by the observations of the present survey which may be summarised as follows: 1) The Menai Strait is an area of very unusual shores of great ecological interest. 2) This is because of a wide variety of rock types and other substrata and especially because these are subjected to strong tidal currents which are most rapid where wave action is minimal. This interest is not uniform, however, and some parts of the area stand out as particularly exciting: 1) Church Island and the adjacent shores, 2) Black Rock, 3) Puffin Island and Penmon, 4) Ynys y Moch and adjacent shores, 5) Gorad y Gyt to the Britainnia Bridge, 6) Llanddwyn, 7) Dinas Dinlle. Black Rock and Ynys y Moch are included in this list because of their past glories rather than their present depressed state. These shores make a particularly strong case for a policy of protection to prevent further damage by bait-digging. In the case of Ynys y Moch, some active restoration measures are also practicable but the recovery of shores like Black Rock will require a long period of peace. Llanddwyn and Dinas Dinlle are not high on the list because, though both include species not found elsewhere in the Strait, neither is particular rich by comparison with boulder or rocky shores farther along the north Wales coast. However, all these shores are of great interest and worthy of special efforts to conserve and protect. There are also stretches of the Strait where the littoral interest is not great. These must include the shores from Beaumaris to Ynys Gaint; Plas Newydd to Tal y Foel; Britainnia Bridge to Caenarvon. Further investigation is merited into possible reasons for absence or variations in flora and fauna on different sides of man-made structures in some isolated localities. There is no doubt that the Church Island region and whole of the Swillies shores between the bridges would merit NNR status in any assessment of British coasts. The inclusion of other parts of the Menai Strait must depend partly on the philosophy behind marine reserves. Thus the limits of Puffin Island to Llanddwyn/Dinas Dinlle define a clear geographical area and include, in the last two shores, typical (though not the richest) examples of certain habitats. The NE end of the Strait, however, is intrinsically more interesting than the SW and the Puffin Island, Black Rocks, Cae Coch and Penmon shores are worthy of inclusion on their own merits. This implies three possible limits: 1) The central reach, for which an overwhelming case exists, 2) The central and NE reaches, from Puffin Island to the Brittainnia Bridge, for which a strong case can be made on ecological grounds, 3) The whole of the Strait, for which the case tends to be more a matter of geographical unity. The historical aspect of conservation must also be considered. There are two main issues related to different time scales. In the longer scale, there are a series of structures used since the middle ages in a method of fishing, peculiar to the Menai Strait and surviving in various states of dilapidation. A major gap in our knowledge appears from this survey relating to these man-made structures and the activities of fishermen and other users of the waters in previous years. In the last 10 - 20 years, there has been an irreplaceable loss of local knowledge by the death of so many elderly people who had earned their living from the Straits. It is now probably too late to save more than a fraction of this once widespread knowledge, but an effort should certainly be made before the last remnants disappear. These Goradau should be made the subject of special conservation measures; one or more could be restored and used experimentally to establish the methods and efficiency of the fishery. Fundamental biological information would almost certainly be acquired at the same time. The most obvious Gorad on which to begin would be Gorad Bach near Beaumaris Life Boat House, which was the most recently used trap and where knowledge of the methods still survives. On a shorter time scale, extensive recording of animals and plants was carried out in the years 1887 - 1891 on Puffin Island, in other parts of the region in the next few years. This gives a picture of these shores at a point in time since when changes have occurred. We are approaching a hundred years since that surge of activity and another intensive recording period would produce very interesting comparisons and might be a very appropriate start to the management plan of a new reserve. In this connection it might be added that there are areas of potential interest which have never been adequately explored. These include Ynys Gorad Goch, the Brittainnia Rock, the Platters and Swilly rock; it is ironic that these are within the central area which possesses, in Church Island, the most intensively studied shores of all. In fact, the establishment of a Marine Nature Reserve in the Menai Strait is not merely an attempt to preserve a very well known stretch of coast - it can be a stimulus to more active investigation of a surprisingly incompletely explored area.

It opens to the south-west and its mouth is partially protected by the small MacCormaig Isles. The main body of the loch is relatively straight, with a fringe of rocks or gravel giving way to a sandy or muddy seabed. There are a number of arms to the loch which add considerably to the diversity of habitats present. Linne Mhuirich forms an arm to the west, with a constricted mouth into Loch Sween forming an area of tidal rapids. At the head of the loch, arms include the silled Caol Scotnish. Adjacent to Loch Sween, once connected to it but now separated by causeway, is Loch na Cille. Loch Sween has been proposed as a Marine Nature Reserve by NCC on account of the high scientific interest and conservation importance of the habitats and communities within the loch. Although a site of historical marine biological recording and research, NCC commissioned extensive systematic littoral and sublittoral surveys in 1982. Further information was required on the distribution and types of littoral habitats and communities present to assess the relative importances of individual areas and the integrated importance of the whole loch. The aims of the shore surveys in 1985 were; to investigate the shores around Ceann an t-Sailein; to assess any temporal variation in faunal communities, particularly molluscan, in the Linne Mhuirich area; and to describe the shores of Loch na Cille. Survey work was carried out during spring and autumn visits. Descriptions of all the sites are included in the report, which also contains a detailed species list and tables showing the numbers of Mollusca associated with algae. The discussion is limited to a summary of the more important information found during the spring surveys. The report concludes that Ceann an t-Sailein adds another habitat type (a shallow tidal bay with a clay floor) to those already known in Loch Sween. Several community types were recorded from the sediment shores. Further variability in molluscan populations was noted but showed no clear pattern which could be related to seasonality.

The Sarns (reefs) are interesting geological features, being shallow sublittoral glacial moraines. The survey was conducted from the hard boat `St Margaret', and based at Abersoch on the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales. Daily trips were made out to the reefs, and diving operations were based on the hard boat with inflatable tender for divers. At each site surveyed, records were made of abundance of plants and animals, and habitats were described. Suction samples were taken of sediment infauna at several sites. Photographs were taken to illustrate habitats, communities and species. The Sarns were remarkable for the extensive areas of distinctive communities on `unstable' substrata. A wide variety of algae, particularly Phaeophyta (brown algae), was recorded. At most survey sites, algae were dense and animal species were fewer and less varied. Twenty sites were surveyed, and descriptions of the different habitats and communities found on the reefs are given. The reefs were composed entirely of `unstable' substrata, of a wide range of sizes from large boulders down to fine sand. Distinctive communities dominated by ephemeral algae, were present in the sublittoral fringe on the reef crests, where there were mixed substrata exposed to fast tidal currents and strong wave action. In slightly deeper water, dense foliose algae dominated all hard substrata, with few animals present. Between 4 m and 9 m, Halidrys siliquosa forests covered extensive areas on boulders and cobbles in sediment. Pebbles were patchy but with a characteristic flora. In deeper water off the ends of the reefs, animal communities with a wide variety of species were present on tideswept boulders. Areas between the reefs were mainly covered with sand, and not investigated thoroughly. The conservation importance of the reefs as a whole is assessed, and of the 10 community types described. 11 algal and 4 animal species are identified as being of particular scientific interest. Many of the communities described are considered of regional or local importance; however the current-swept reef crests and the extensive Halidrys forests are considered to be of higher importance. The reefs as a whole are probably unique sublittoral features in the British Isles. Further work is recommended on Sarn-y-Bwch and Cynfelin Patches, both inadequately surveyed.

Also, public concern over the inadequacy of sewage disposal facilities in the Yarmouth area. At present, thirty outfalls discharge crude sewage into the lower River Bure, causing some organic enrichment to the lower River Bure. The survey was carried out in the first week in June 1987. Eight sites were sampled with a cylindrical corer (15cms diam by 20cms deep). Three replicates were taken from the mid horizontal distance point between high and low tides. Cores were taken soon after low water on each occassion. A sub sample from each sample was taken for sediment analysis, the remainder was sieved through a 500 micron sieve. The survey suggests sewage enrichment of the lower estuary increases the productivity but does not adversely affect the species diversity. It was also postulated that much of the mercury discharged through the Norwich sewage works during the previous twenty years has accumulated in the sediments of Breydon Water. The estuary was found to support a healthy, but undiverse invertebrate fauna. The lack of diversity was thought to be due to the homogeneity of the sediment types and the lack of extremes of salinity within Breydon Water.

The area was mapped using a combination of echo soundings and observations by divers. An area of earlier dumping activity was also included in the survey. The habitats and communities inside the area and on the surrounding sea bed were described and documented by diving biologists in September 1985, and results compared with those obtained during a survey carried out prior to the latest dumping programme. The main effect of the dredge spoil was to smother all life over approximately 23,000 m/2 of the sea bed. Outside this area of blanket cover there was increased siltation on the sea bed for at least 200 m to the north. Older clay from previous dumping operations was little different in appearance from the new clay and had only been colonised by a few species giving rise to a community very different from that of the natural sea bed. Sites well to the south around the Marine Hotel did not appear to be affected. The sea bed under the recent and earlier spoil dredgings, amounting in total to around 10% of the available habitat of mixed sediments, stones and shells is thus thought to be irreversibly changed by these operations and it is recommended that no further dumping of this type of spoil should be undertaken within the estuary.

The `Y'-shaped loch system, comprising Lochs a' Chairn Bhain, Glencoul, Glendhu, Beag and Shark, is 15 km long and reaches maximum depths of 111 m in the deepest of its six basins. The relatively complex series of basins and sills categorize the system as a type `C' (Milne 1972), and result in the absence of the seasonal fjordic loch stagnation of deep water shown by other fjordic lochs. The system is steep-sided, with a relatively small littoral area, bedrock and boulders extending through the littoral and into the circalittoral in almost all areas. Sediment predominates in the middle of the loch. The sediment composition depends heavily upon the level of exposure to water movement with coarse, clean sediments in Eddrachillis Bay grading to fine soft muds in the deep water basins and at the loch heads. The sequence of sediments is interupted in the narrows region at Kylesku and on the sills, where increased current speed results in the presence of coarser sediments. The area in which the loch lies is fairly remote, with little habitation and no shore-based industry. Major uses of the loch are scampi fishing, by trawl and creel, and fish farming. The number of leased fish farm sites is currently at least 12, not all of which were occupied by fish farms at the time of the survey. Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest border on Loch Cairnbawn, one at the head of Loch Glencoul, and the other along most of the southern shore of Loch a'Chairn Bhain. Very few marine biological studies have been carried out in the loch, these being limited to some littoral recording and some grab sampling of sublittoral sediments. The present survey, carried out in October 1988, aimed to describe the marine habitats and communities present in the loch and to assess their nature conservation importance. A total of 40 sites were visited, of which 4 were littoral and 36 were sublittoral. At each site the abundance of the epiflora and fauna was recorded and the habitats described. No infaunal sampling was carried out. Thirty two sublittoral and three littoral habitat types were identified, and these are described in this report. A list of the taxa recorded is also given. The communities present in Eddrachillis Bay were open coast in nature, and there was a transition to sheltered sea loch communities further into the system. The narrows area in the middle of the loch an exception to the gradual transition, with the presence of a range of high energy habitats due to the accelerated tidal streams in this region, and was one of the more interesting features of the system. The scientific interest and conservation importance of the area have been assessed using standard criteria. These have been applied to each of the habitats or community types identified which have been provisionally graded as of Local, Regional, National or International importance. Species of particular scientific and conservation interest have been provisionally graded as of provisional Regional or National importance. Loch Cairnbawn appears to contain a good range of the habitats and community types typical of sheltered, fjordic sea lochs, with no particularly unique features.

The first two are connected by the East Kyle of Bute, a shallow channel running between Bute and the mainland. Loch Long is the largest fjordic loch in the group; Loch Striven has some similarities to Loch Long and is the second largest. Loch Goil forms a north-west trending branch of Loch Long, separated from the main body of the loch by a shallow sill. The latter three lochs all have a small percentage of intertidal to total area. The Gareloch is relatively shallow without subtidal rocky features, but does have a sill towards the mouth. The main feature of Loch Riddon is the Ruel Estuary, which has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The entrance into the East Kyle from Loch Riddon is via the shallower tide-swept narrows around the Burnt Islands; the area experiences the strongest current surveyed in the north Clyde sealochs. The Holyloch has no sill/basin features, the seabed sloping gradually out to deeper water in the Firth of Clyde. Like the Gareloch, it has a paucity of sublittoral bedrock. The whole area has been affected by sewage pollution with some improvement over the last 25 years, but the effects are still noticeable in the Gareloch and Holyloch. There is a strong Naval presence throughout the lochs with large submarine bases in the Holyloch and Gareloch. Twenty-one littoral and 82 sublittoral sites were surveyed, from which 27 habitat or community types were described. A list of the taxa recorded is also given. All the lochs in this system were characterized by sheltered communities. Only a few shores had communities typical of moderately exposed conditions, dominated by barnacles, the majority being fucoid-dominated and giving way to Laminaria saccharina forests in the infralittoral. Algal diversity in the infralittoral was low throughout the lochs, grazing echinoderms and chitons leaving large areas of denuded rock with abundant encrusting coralline algae. Steeply sloping bedrock in the circalittoral supporting a Protanthea simplex/Neocrania anomala community with Sabella pavonina and Ciona intestinalis. On most sites, however, bedrock and boulder slopes finished around the limit of the lower infralittoral/upper circalittoral and were replaced by shelly and sandy mixed sediment slopes with mud, finally leading onto mud plains in the deeper areas of the lochs. Scavenging mobile species, including hermit crabs, gobies and dragonets plus sediment-burrowing anemones Cerianthus lloydii, slender seapens Virgularia mirabilis, burrowing and tube-forming polychaetes and burrowing bivalve molluscs were found on these mixed sediments. Deeper mud, well worked by crustaceans including the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus and the echiuran Maxmuelleria lankesteri was found in most of the lochs, other areas having beds of burrowing brittlestars, Amphiura spp. The large cerianthid anemone Pachycerianthus multiplicatus was also found in muddy sediments. Tidal streams affected sediment grading in the East Kyle. Here coarser and sandier sediments supported beds of brittlestars Ophiothrix fragilis and Ophiocomina nigra and the infauna included the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum and the burrowing holothurian Labidoplax digitata. Two rare species were found in Loch Goil; the holothurian Ocnus planci and the tunicate Styela gelatinosa. The latter is a new British record and therefore assessed as of international conservation importance.

At several sites the substrate was unsuitable for grab sampling and either no sample was obtained or only a qualitative sample was taken. Data from the 43 sites at which quantitative samples were obtained have been analysed by a variety of statistical techniques to determine similarities between the sites. The area has an extremely diverse fauna; over four hundred taxa were recorded in the samples. Sites had an average of 58 taxa and 286 individuals per grab sample. There was very high variability in the number of taxa per grab sample, ranging from 3 to 158. The majority of taxa and individuals were polychaetes, with crustaceans and molluscs the next most important groups in terms of the number of taxa and individuals respectively. Analysis of the biological data and an examination of the sediment types indicated that four major and three smaller groups (clusters) could be recognised. The biology of each of the clusters is described and related to the underlying sediment type. Fifty sampling positions in the study area were arranged in a rectangular grid pattern, with six major sampling lines running east-west and nine oriented north-south.

The aim of the survey was to establish whether a commercial fishery with this gear was viable commercially and environmentally sustainable.There was initially a period of gear design and construction which, together with some unavailability of either the vessel of Cefas staff, delayed the project until the winter of 2013/14. The weather was exceptionally poor and delayed the start of work such that funding had to be carried forward into the next financial year. Fieldwork commenced in May at a site off Southport, but despite the experimental gear deploying and working as envisaged, no razor clams were caught.It was decided that a new fishing area should be tried and at the suggestion of the skipper, a diving company was engaged to survey positions where catches had been made previously. One position was found to have a significant density of razor clams and this was chosen as a target for the next trip. Unfortunately this position was in too shallow water for *Harmoni *to reach and deploying the gear a short distance to seaward produced no catch. After further tows through the area which also proved barren, the project was abandoned.","MethodsThe gearThe razor clams respond to electrical pulses by vacating their burrows allowing them to be collected by the cage. The aim was to optimise the towing speed, voltage, pulse frequency and the angle of the blade at the front of the collection cage both in terms of the catching efficiency of the gear for the target species and minimising environmental impact. A camera was to be deployed on the collection cage to monitor the action of the sledge on the seabed and observe the reaction of benthic organisms to the electric pulses.",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary objective of the project was to obtain data on the differences between the currently permitted and proposed new trawl configurations, principally to move from the widespread use of 80mm mesh cod end to a default of 100mm. This information will help to provide evidence on the performance of more selective trawl configurations to inform on proposed changes to technical measures regulations in the southwest otter trawl mixed fishery.For this purpose, two trials lasting 6 days each took place in ICES Division 7e on the twin-rig otter trawler Rockfisher (SU6) in the months of October to December 2020. The vessel conducted simultaneous comparative tows of the control gear and two experimental gears. The first trial compared two trawls, both with 100mm cod ends, and one with an 80mm square mesh panel (SMP) and the other with 100mm SMP. A total of 19 paired hauls were collected for this trial. The second trial compared 100mm cod end with an 80mm SMP to an 80mm cod end with an 80mm SMP (as normally used by the vessel). A total of 14 paired hauls were completed for the second trial.At each station sampled, shot and haul, positional, times, depths and towing speed information were recorded, and for all species of fish length distribution data were taken, including collecting data on the benthic component of the catch.","A fixed routine for handling and sorting the catch was maintained throughout the trials. Catches from the two cod ends were always kept separate and were processed as either the retained or discarded fraction. Cefas observers sampled using standard techniques. For each haul, all fish species caught were measured to the nearest cm below. Sub sampling was necessary on occasions when the fish catch was large, and raising factors were calculated accordingly. Additionally, benthos was separated from the discarded fish, identified down to group level, and counted. The results were compiled in Excel and plotted graphically in R.",Y,Exclude - marine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generally speaking the nodes are closer together through central London. Additional nodes were added where tributaries join the estuary to help model how the flows from the tributary affect water levels in the estuary. The 10-Year Review added additional nodes (reducing the spacing) to improve our understanding of how the water levels change along the estuary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fewer large fishes will reduce the amount of predation on smaller prey species and allow increases in their abundance and biomass. In turn this will affect the structure and stability of the ecosystem.  The indicator responds to fishing impacts on the fish community because larger fish are more likely to be caught by trawls and because larger species of fish are more likely to decline in number for a given rate of fishing.  When fish communities are more heavily fished, the proportion of large fish is expected to fall and, when fishing is reduced, the proportion of large fish is expected to rise.  Some variation in the proportion of large fish will be driven by environmental variation, but available evidence suggests environmental effects on this indicator are relatively small in relation to fishing effects over periods of a few years.The indicator shows changes in the proportion, by weight, of large individuals equal to or over 40cm in length in fish populations in the North-western part of the North Sea.  The indicator is based on standardised annual research survey trawls.  During the 1980s, large fish in the North Sea fish community included cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), saithe (Pollachius virens), ling (Molva molva), anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) and rays (Batoidea).  Recently, haddock have formed a substantial part of the large fish catches in the North-western North Sea, along with cod and saithe.

Evidence will also help to engage the public, natural resource managers and business to actively address biodiversity loss.  There are therefore a range of geographic scales of decision making (from local to national), and audiences (public sector, industry, public, research, etc.) that have an interest in the availability of biodiversity data.  The indicator is focused on the availability of data collated by the National Biodiversity Network for decision making - evaluating actual use within decision making is more difficult.Millions of biological observations (records) have been recorded in the UK over the past century by a wide variety of organisations and individuals.  Most of these people are volunteers who organise themselves through many national and local societies and recording schemes.  The UK government (through its conservation and environmental agencies), local government and non-government wildlife-related organisations all collect and use biodiversity data.  Information is held by many different organisations and the individuals who collect it, in a variety of formats, from computer databases to handwritten record cards.  This means that although a huge amount of information exists, it is not always easy to access.This indicator provides an evaluation of the number of records added to the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) Gateway in a particular year, and the resolution of those data, as a proxy for the evidence available to underpin conservation decision making.

At each station sampled, shot and haul, positional, depth and times information were recorded, and for all species of fish and shellfish length distribution data were taken.

Both the Eastern and Western surveys of the study area are carried out by one commercial beam trawler during late summer and early autumn. In all, there are 90 target stations equally spread over the western and eastern surveys that have been sampled consistently over all years, from 2003 onwards. Historically, there were more stations but not all were sampled every year and the survey design was thus simplified to cover only the 90 core stations, maintaining the survey for the long term.At each station the catch for the port and starboard gears were combined, which was subsequently split into the retained and discarded component prior to sampling. Fish and shellfish were identified to either species or if not the highest possible taxa, and were measured in accordance with Cefas‚Äô standard practices. When necessary catches by species were a subsampled prior to measuring. Species of Cephalopod were measured, except for Octopii, which were counted.

They utilise sunlight energy and dissolved nutrients converting these into organic materials which are often consumed by higher life forms such as fish. As phytoplankton are short lived and derive their nutrients from the water; they are an ideal indicator of changing nutrient conditions and therefore useful for assessing pollution of transitional waters  In natural waters a high number of different species of phytoplankton would be expected with high levels of growth in the spring and autumn (blooms). There would be a natural population decline due to nutrient depletion and grazing pressures in the summer.
