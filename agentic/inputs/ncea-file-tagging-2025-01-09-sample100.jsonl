The area has an extremely diverse fauna; over four hundred taxa were recorded in the samples. Sites had an average of 58 taxa and 286 individuals per grab sample. There was very high variability in the number of taxa per grab sample, ranging from 3 to 158. The majority of taxa and individuals were polychaetes, with crustaceans and molluscs the next most important groups in terms of the number of taxa and individuals respectively. Analysis of the biological data and an examination of the sediment types indicated that four major and three smaller groups (clusters) could be recognised.

Underway automatic sampling followed by flow cytometry was used for assessing mesoscale spatial variability of microorganisms. Coarse-scale (CTD) and fine-scale (PumpCast profiler) vertical distribution of microorganisms was determined, with dominant microbial prokaryotic and eukaryotic groups quantified by flow cytometry. Samples were collected and processed for subsequent molecular identification of flow cytometrically sorted dominant microbes. Abundance of larger microplankton organisms was assessed. Microbial respiration in the twilight zone was studied. Group-specific uptake of bicarbonate, phosphate and different nitrogen compounds was determined and group-specific production and grazing assessed using flow sorting. The ambient turnover rates of phosphate, organic phosphorus and labile dissolved organic matter, e.g. amino acids, was bioassayed. In order to put the microbial community data into context, physical and chemical parameters were measured. A ship mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was used to collect information about physical, mesoscale spatial context and, when combined with turbulence profiler data, SeaSoar profiler data and data collected using intensive Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) sampling for dissolved inorganic nutrients, may estimate mesoscale nutrient fluxes into the photic zone.

Tabular and spatial data were joined together using the make query table tool with map contour reference being used as primary/foreign key in a one (spatial record) to many (tabular records) relationship. Data that was captured as point or line features were then buffered to 300m. All features were then clipped to the OS mean high water line. When this required amalgamation it was joined to a 3/4 by 3/8 nautical mile grid with each grid cell being allocated a unique identifer. All further analysis was carried out in SQL server. Outputs from this analysis were then exported as feature classes."}

Bedrock geology describes the main mass of solid rocks forming the earth's crust. Bedrock is present everywhere, whether exposed at surface in outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits or water bodies. Geological names are based on the lithostratigraphic or lithodemic hierarchy. This means rock bodies are arranged into units based on rock-type and geological time of formation. Where rock-types do not fit into the lithostratigraphic scheme, for example intrusive, deformed rocks subjected to heat and pressure resulting in new or changed rock types; then their classification is based on their rock-type or lithological composition. This assesses visible features such as texture, structure, mineralogy. Data identifying linear features (shown as polylines) represent geological faults at the ground or bedrock surface (beneath superficial deposits). Geological faults occur where a body of bedrock has been fractured and displaced by large scale processes affecting the earth's crust (tectonic forces).

The survey hauls are not laid out systematically as a grid, as in current International Bottom Trawl Surveys (IBTS) and are widely distributed over (especially) southern and central North Sea areas. Gears and protocols were not standardised throughout, due to the long term nature of the series. Surveys took place in each season. Data are lacking for the periods of both World Wars. In some periods (e.g. the early 1900s), all species caught were recorded, whereas in other periods (e.g. 1920s-30s), only the key commercial species (e.g., Plaice, Sole and Cod) were recorded systematically. Note that some surveys targeted particular species (notably Plaice).Survey took place between 12/03/1965 and 25/03/1965 on PlatessaEquipment used during this survey :- High Speed Tow Net Guildline system 76cm- Sole trawl with bobbins codend catchSurvey operations were undertaken on 135 stations27 different species were caught on this survey", "lineage": "Surveys range from 1902 until the 1970s.Over the decades, at least 11 different Research Vessels (RVs) carried out surveys using different gear deployments and catch sampling protocols over time.

Also, public concern over the inadequacy of sewage disposal facilities in the Yarmouth area. At present, thirty outfalls discharge crude sewage into the lower River Bure, causing some organic enrichment to the lower River Bure. The survey was carried out in the first week in June 1987. Eight sites were sampled with a cylindrical corer (15cms diam by 20cms deep). Three replicates were taken from the mid horizontal distance point between high and low tides. Cores were taken soon after low water on each occassion. A sub sample from each sample was taken for sediment analysis, the remainder was sieved through a 500 micron sieve. The survey suggests sewage enrichment of the lower estuary increases the productivity but does not adversely affect the species diversity. It was also postulated that much of the mercury discharged through the Norwich sewage works during the previous twenty years has accumulated in the sediments of Breydon Water. The estuary was found to support a healthy, but undiverse invertebrate fauna. The lack of diversity was thought to be due to the homogeneity of the sediment types and the lack of extremes of salinity within Breydon Water. Breydon Water satisfied the biological, chemical, and aesthetic criteria for a class A estuary under the UK Estuarine Classification Scheme. Breydon Water is important as an over-wintering ground for waders, wildfowl and gulls.", "lineage": "This survey was extracted from a Marine Recorder snapshot."}

This dataset includes the collation of aerial imagery for 44 sites around the Welsh coastline, selected to contain rocky shore, saltmarsh or Sabellaria alveolata across temporal scales providing suitable data for comparisons of change through time, both anthropogenic and biological. In order for comparisons to present day imagery, current aerial imagery was also obtained in this study. Photographic aerial images containing features of conservation value (specifically rocky shores, Sabellaria alveolata inhabited shores and saltmarsh areas) within Wales were obtained. Historic photographic aerial images that contained features of conservation value (specifically rocky shores, Sabellaria alveolata inhabited shores and saltmarsh areas) within Wales were selected from expert knowledge and Countryside Council for Wales's collection of habitat maps. The aim of this project was to collate, digitise and georeference aerial photographic imagery for sites that had multi-year overlap. Accuracies of less than 5 m RMS was obtained (with the exception of Treath Lafan, 1995, and the Dyfi Estuary, 1975). At these saltmarsh locations, there were too few ground control points to achieve this accuracy.", "lineage": "Rocky shores sites included Bull Bay, Cemlyn Bay, Cemaes Bay, Holyhead, Penrhyn (East side of Holyhead bay) and Trearddur Bay. Sabellaria sites included Aberaeron, Mochras and Llanddulas and S. alveolata. Those images remaining as photographic prints were digitised using an Epson GT-15000 scanner at 1200 dots per inch (dpi). Images in adjacent locations were mosaicked with the image panorama generating software Autopano Giga 2.6, with a root mean square error (RMS) of less than 5 m where possible. Aerial images were then georeferenced in ArcMap10.0, using Ordnance Survey maps where features were readily visible both on the map and on the image. On occasion, images were georeferenced using aerial imagery that was already georeferenced. Accuracies of less than 5 m RMS was obtained. Georeferenced images were then rectified with the ArcMap10 Nearest Neighbour (for discrete data) function as uncompressed TIFFs, before compression to JPEG format with 100% image quality. Image clarity and descriptions were given for individual images. Spatial reference for all data is British National Grid. Present-day low-altitude imagery was captured with a time-lapse compact Canon camera (D10) with no flash and infinity focus. The camera was attached to either a kite or a helium balloon and led over the sites of interest. The resultant images were mosaicked with Autopano Giga 2.6 achieving the lowest RMS possible and visual clarity. Ground control points were marked during the aerial fly over with a dGPS (Leica GS50 or Magellan MobileMapper 6). On several occasions, dominant habitat types were also walked round in the field providing habitat ground-truthing, logging polylines in the GPS systems. The data from the GPS systems were post-processed using ephemeris data from a fixed station (Morpeth), to achieve accuracies of less than 1.5 m for ground control points and less than 3 m for walk-around data."}

An underwater video and still photograph survey was conducted by Heriot-Watt University and SNH for MS between the 6th and 11th September 2011 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 74 sites within the Southern Trench shelf deep area. The images and infaunal samples, analysed under SNH contract by Heriot-Watt University, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. An infaunal grab survey was also undertaken on this survey at a subset of 20 drop-down video stations, selected to target areas of historic records of shelf deep habitat and where PMFs were most likely to occur with the overall aim of gaining a broader understanding of the habitat type and assist in biotope assignment. The vessel RV Alba na Mara was used for this survey - samples were also collected from Noss Head on the same cruise.", "lineage": "This subtidal seabed data from the Southern Trench was collected by Heriot-Watt University and SNH between the 6th and 11th September 2011 onboard the vessel RV Alba na Mara. Survey stations were chosen using a stratified random coarse grid pattern with a higher density of stations in most likely PMF areas. Video images were obtained from a combined total of 74 drop-down video drift tows deployed just above the seabed for 5-10mins. Still photographs were also taken approximately taken every minute manually. A Konsberg OE14-366 colour zoom camera was used alongside a Konsberg 14-208 digital stills camera, with camera and lights mounted onto a sled for this survey. Positional, time and depth data are available for the start and end of video runs. Analyses of the video footage was undertaken by Heriot-Watt University, contracted by SNH, to describe the physical structure and species assemblages present. Based on the physical and biological attributes, biotopes were allocated. Species present were identified and quantified using the semi-quantitative MNCR SACFOR scale for colonies and large aggregations of individuals, where possible, or using numerical abundance of individuals. Where video runs traversed a sequence of biotopes, the runs are split into corresponding segments with the transition points recorded using time. Segmentation of runs was not practicable in the case of mosaics of recurring biotopes, in which case all biotopes observed were simply listed. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence PMFs and MPA search features, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance. A small number of pre-planned sampling stations had to be removed due to a high number of creels obstructing the safe deployment of the drop-down video camera. Infaunal samples were collected at 20 stations in the Southern Trench survey area using a 0.1m2 Day grab. Sampling stations for grabs were selected based on a subset of drop-down video sampling stations so as to increase sampling effort in areas where PMFs were most likely to occur. Single sediment grabs were collected at each station to gain a broad understanding of the biotopes present on the seabed. A small sub sample of each grab was taken for particle size analysis (PSA), before being sieved by hand through a 1mm mesh size. Any material retained on the sieve was transferred to a labelled container before being fixed with a buffered 4% formaldehyde solution. A biotope was assigned to each grab sample. PSA and infaunal analysis was also undertaken by Heriot-Watt University."}
