At several sites the substrate was unsuitable for grab sampling and either no sample was obtained or only a qualitative sample was taken. Data from the 43 sites at which quantitative samples were obtained have been analysed by a variety of statistical techniques to determine similarities between the sites. The area has an extremely diverse fauna; over four hundred taxa were recorded in the samples. Sites had an average of 58 taxa and 286 individuals per grab sample. There was very high variability in the number of taxa per grab sample, ranging from 3 to 158. The majority of taxa and individuals were polychaetes, with crustaceans and molluscs the next most important groups in terms of the number of taxa and individuals respectively. Analysis of the biological data and an examination of the sediment types indicated that four major and three smaller groups (clusters) could be recognised. The biology of each of the clusters is described and related to the underlying sediment type.

Note that some surveys targeted particular species (notably Plaice).Survey took place between 12/03/1965 and 25/03/1965 on PlatessaEquipment used during this survey :- High Speed Tow Net Guildline system 76cm- Sole trawl with bobbins codend catchSurvey operations were undertaken on 135 stations27 different species were caught on this survey", "inputs.lineage": "Surveys range from 1902 until the 1970s.Over the decades, at least 11 different Research Vessels (RVs) carried out surveys using different gear deployments and catch sampling protocols over time.

The moorland line is mapped to represent areas of unimproved, moorland vegetation representations to remove areas of non-moorland land from the moorland line. As such, it represents our best mapping of upland moorland in England, and should contain no areas of non-moorland vegetation larger than 5ha in size. This provides a map of deep peaty soils under moorland vegetation. In addition, all areas under 1ha were deleted from the data set. The aim of this was to remove all areas which were smaller than the minimum mappable unit for this exercise and to reduce the total number of polygons to be assessed, while maintaining the greatest possible assessment area.
